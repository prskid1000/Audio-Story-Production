[narrator] The rain was falling with a soft but steady persistence upon the gas-lit streets of London, that vast and shadowed city which seemed to brood eternally beneath its pall of smoke and mystery. It was upon such a night, damp and sullen, that I, Doctor John Watson, was summoned from my own domestic peace into an adventure whose strange turns and startling revelations yet linger in my memory with singular vividness. I shall set it down faithfully here, in the hope that those who follow the exploits of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes may find interest in the peculiar case of The Man with the Twisted Lip.
[narrator] I must begin by confessing that my own role at the outset was quite unconnected to any investigation. Rather, it was the simple call of friendship and duty which led me forth into the night. My dear wife, perceiving my concern for a patient who had slipped grievously in her battle against the malady of opium, had urged me to attend her even at this late hour. And thus, cloaked and gloved against the damp, I made my way to the dismal quarter of the city known as the East End, where the narrow streets were lined with gin shops and opium dens, and where the law held but a feeble dominion.
[watson] I recall thinking, as I walked beneath the dripping eaves, “How different is this world from that of Baker Street, where Holmes sits by his fire, cold pipe in hand, marshalling the facts of some intricate case. Here, the tragedy is of a humbler but no less ruinous sort—the slow poisoning of body and soul.”
[narrator] At length I came to the squalid house known to me as one of ill repute, where men of all classes—sailors, beggars, and even gentlemen in disguise—sought escape from reality in the deadly fumes of the poppy. With some reluctance I entered, and found myself amidst the low murmur of voices, the reek of opium, and the dim glimmer of lamps hung askew upon the peeling walls. The keeper of the den, a lascar of sinister appearance, greeted me with a knowing smile, as though accustomed to the sight of respectable men slinking into his pit of degradation.
[narrator] I inquired after my patient and was soon led to the corner where she lay half-conscious upon a tattered couch. Having ascertained her condition and given what aid I could, I was about to depart when my eye was caught by a familiar figure seated in the shadow, his long limbs stretched, his deerstalker hat pulled low upon his brow.
[watson] “Holmes!” I exclaimed, scarcely believing my senses. “What in Heaven’s name are you doing here, in a place like this?”
[holmes] His thin lips curled into a faint smile as he drew me nearer with a slight motion of the hand. “Hush, Watson. Your voice may carry. I am engaged upon an inquiry of considerable delicacy, and this den is, for the moment, the very heart of my investigation.”
[watson] “But surely—surely such a place is beneath even your most singular methods. What can you hope to learn here amidst this degradation?”
[holmes] “Elementary, my dear fellow. Crime, like disease, must be traced to its breeding grounds. And here, amongst the smoke and the whispers, men reveal truths they would never speak in the bright light of the Strand. But come—your arrival is not ill-timed. There is more afoot tonight than either of us expected.”
[narrator] He rose swiftly, and with that peculiar energy which seemed always to animate him in the pursuit of a case, he guided me from the den and into the street. The rain had slackened, but the cobblestones gleamed with a treacherous sheen. A hansom cab was waiting at the corner, its horse stamping impatiently.
[holmes] “Quickly, Watson. A lady of your acquaintance has need of you, and by extension, of me. We go to Kentish Town. There is no time to lose.”
[narrator] Perplexed but obedient, I climbed into the cab beside him. The horse sprang forward, and the damp night air rushed past as Holmes, ever composed, produced his clay pipe and filled it with his black shag tobacco. He puffed once or twice, then turned to me with that piercing gaze which seemed to look through a man’s very soul.
[watson] “Tell me at once what this is about, Holmes. You speak of a lady of my acquaintance—who can it be?”
[holmes] “It is none other than Mrs. St. Clair, the wife of a respectable gentleman of the city. She is, at this very moment, in a state of the most acute agitation. She believes her husband has been foully used in the neighborhood of that very opium den we have just quitted. Her message reached me not an hour ago, and knowing that your medical obligations might draw you eastward, I took the liberty of seeking you there. The case, Watson, promises to be one of those puzzles where the outward appearance is grotesque, and the inward truth, stranger still.”
[watson] “Mr. St. Clair? I do not recall having met the man.”
[holmes] “He is a person of good repute, engaged in certain mercantile ventures, and known for his probity. Yet it is in connection with him that we shall find ourselves in the very thick of London’s underworld, and perhaps face a deception so bold that even I must take care to untangle it.”
[narrator] Thus did Holmes tantalize me with hints, but no more, until at last we reached the modest residence in Kentish Town. The cab drew up before a neat little villa, where a light still burned in the window despite the late hour. As we entered, we were greeted by a lady whose pale countenance and trembling hands betrayed her distress.
[mrs_stclair] “Oh, Mr. Holmes! Thank Heaven you have come. And you too, Doctor Watson. You are both most kind. I am nearly beside myself with dread, for I know not whether my husband be alive or dead.”
[holmes] Holmes bowed with his accustomed courtesy, but his eyes missed nothing—the disorder of the room, the hastily discarded shawl, the anxious glances toward the door. “Compose yourself, madam. You have sent for us to aid you, and aid you we shall. But you must give us every particular, without reservation.”
[mrs_stclair] “Yes, yes, I shall tell you all. My husband, Neville St. Clair, set out this morning for the city. He is a most punctual man, and never has he failed to return by evening to his supper. Yet today he did not come. In my anxiety, I took it upon myself to go in search of him. I knew that his business would take him through the East End, and so I made my way there, though it is a place I dread.”
[narrator] She shuddered, and I offered her a glass of water, which she accepted gratefully before continuing.
[mrs_stclair] “It was near to the riverside, in that vile quarter where the opium dens abound, that I saw him—or thought I saw him—at a window above the sign of the Bar of Gold. He was leaning out, and for an instant I caught his face in the lamplight. I cried out to him, but in that very moment he seemed to be dragged back violently, as though by some unseen hand. And then—the window was closed, and I saw him no more.”
[watson] “Good Lord! That is most sinister indeed.”
[holmes] “Pray continue, madam. What followed?”
[mrs_stclair] “I rushed to the place at once, but the lascar who keeps the establishment would not admit me. I was near to fainting when a constable came by, and to him I explained my plight. Together we forced our way inside, but there was no sign of my husband. Only a most hideous creature—a beggar with a twisted lip—sat crouched among the pillows. The constable searched him, and found upon his person a few coins and a letter. And here—here is the last terrible proof.”
[narrator] With trembling hands she drew from her bosom a small parcel wrapped in paper. She unfolded it, and to our astonishment there fell upon the table a child’s toy—a wooden block with letters upon it, smeared with blood. I recognized it instantly, for my own children had such playthings.
[mrs_stclair] “It is my son’s. Neville carried it with him this morning, to amuse the little one when he returned home. And now it is stained thus—oh, Mr. Holmes, what can it mean?”
[holmes] Holmes took up the toy, examined it minutely, and then set it down. His face was inscrutable, yet his eyes gleamed with that light I knew so well—the light of fierce intellectual engagement.
[holmes] “We must go at once to the Bar of Gold, Watson. The night is not yet spent, and if there is truth to be learned, it lies there.”
[narrator] Mrs. St. Clair caught his sleeve with desperate urgency.
[mrs_stclair] “Promise me, Mr. Holmes—promise me that you will bring him back to me, dead or alive. Only do not leave me in this torment of uncertainty.”
[holmes] “I promise, madam, that I shall leave no stone unturned in my search. Whether your husband lives or has met some darker fate, you shall have the truth.”
[narrator] And so, without delay, Holmes and I once more plunged into the labyrinth of London by night, the case unfolding before us like some dreadful enigma whose solution would test even the limits of his remarkable genius.
[narrator] The hansom cab rattled swiftly over the cobbles as Holmes and I sped once more toward the East End. The hour was late, and most respectable citizens were long abed, yet the darker quarters of London seemed to grow only more animated. Women of disheveled attire called from shadowed doorways, while drunken sailors reeled arm-in-arm, singing coarse songs beneath the dripping lamps. A chill wind rose from the river, carrying with it the mingled odors of tar, smoke, and decay. Holmes, seated opposite me, remained in profound concentration, his eyes half-closed, the toy block turning slowly in his lean fingers as though it held some secret known only to him.
[watson] “Holmes, do you truly believe Neville St. Clair was abducted before his wife’s very eyes? The idea chills the blood. And yet, might she not have been deceived by some resemblance, some figure seen dimly through the lamplight?”
[holmes] “My dear Watson, I never permit myself the luxury of premature conclusions. Whether Mrs. St. Clair’s testimony is accurate or not, it is an essential fact that she herself believes it true. That alone renders it of value. Our task is to separate the certain from the conjectural, the proved from the imagined. And for that, we must examine the Bar of Gold for ourselves.”
[narrator] At length, the cab drew up beside a crooked alley which sloped down toward the Thames. There, beneath a weathered signboard depicting a gilded chalice, stood the squalid den which had already played so sinister a part in the day’s events. A solitary lamp flickered above its door, throwing a fitful glow upon the wet pavement. The lascar keeper, with his turban askew, regarded us with sullen suspicion as we entered.
[holmes] “Good evening. You recall me, no doubt. I was here earlier tonight.”
[lascar] “Yes, sahib, I remember. But there is nothing here for you now. No trouble tonight.”
[holmes] “That remains to be seen. My companion and I shall have a look about. Do not trouble yourself to follow us.”
[narrator] Holmes spoke with such quiet authority that the lascar, though plainly resentful, made no further protest. We passed through the noisome chamber where men lay sprawled in drugged stupor, their features ghastly in the lamplight. The heavy odour of opium clung to the walls and seemed to weigh upon the very air. Holmes led me with unerring step to a narrow stair which creaked beneath our tread, and so we ascended to the upper room.
[narrator] It was a low chamber, poorly furnished, with a barred window overlooking the alley. Holmes crossed at once to that window and examined the sill with his magnifying lens. The rain had washed it clean, yet I saw him nod with satisfaction as he traced some faint mark invisible to my eye.
[holmes] “Watson, observe here—though the paint is blistered, there remains the smudge of a hand, pressed hard against the wood. And see here—fibres, caught upon the latch. The window was not merely closed, but shut in great haste. I do not doubt Mrs. St. Clair’s account. Her husband was indeed here.”
[watson] “But if so, where is he now? And by whom was he seized?”
[holmes] “That, my friend, is the riddle we are come to answer. Yet consider—the lady described a man with a twisted lip. Such a person is not easily forgotten. Let us see what manner of fellow he may be.”
[narrator] As though in answer to Holmes’s words, the door opened and Constable Barton, a stout young officer, entered the chamber, his lantern casting long shadows upon the walls.
[constable_barton] “Good evening, Mr. Holmes, Doctor. You come in good time. The fellow is secured below, and awaits your inspection.”
[holmes] “Excellent. And what have you found here?”
[constable_barton] “Nothing of Mr. St. Clair, sir, save for this.”
[narrator] He held up a bundle of clothes—neatly folded, and undeniably of good quality. Within the coat pocket glimmered a handful of sovereigns, and in the waistcoat lay a pocket-book bearing the name Neville St. Clair.
[watson] “It is his, beyond all doubt. And yet—how should his garments be here, while he himself has vanished?”
[holmes] “A question worthy of our utmost attention. But let us first behold the occupant of this chamber.”
[narrator] We descended once more, and were conducted to a corner where, upon a heap of rags, crouched as loathsome a creature as ever I beheld. His face was twisted into a perpetual leer, his lip drawn awry so as to expose a row of yellowed teeth. A mass of unkempt hair hung about his brow, and his small eyes glittered with mingled fear and defiance. He clutched a clay pipe in his claw-like hand, and when we approached he snarled like some cornered animal.
[holmes] “Your name?”
[twisted_lip] “They call me Boone, sir. Hugh Boone. And a begging life I lead, for there’s little else for the likes of me.”
[holmes] “You occupy this chamber?”
[twisted_lip] “Aye, and pay rent for it. But you will not find your gentleman here. I know nothing of him.”
[watson] “But his clothes were discovered above. How do you explain that?”
[twisted_lip] “I cannot explain what I never saw. Maybe he left them, maybe someone planted them. All I know is that I mind my own trade, and no harm in it.”
[narrator] His voice was thick and guttural, his manner evasive. Holmes regarded him with cool detachment, though I could perceive the keen play of thought behind those sharp grey eyes.
[holmes] “You deny, then, any knowledge of Mr. Neville St. Clair? And yet Mrs. St. Clair herself avers that she saw her husband at your window this very evening.”
[twisted_lip] “Then the lady is mistaken, for no man has been here save me.”
[holmes] Holmes turned to the constable. “You have searched the premises thoroughly?”
[constable_barton] “Every inch, sir. No trace of the missing man, alive or dead.”
[holmes] “And yet here are his garments, his pocket-book, his very rings. Curious indeed. Boone, you will remain in custody until further inquiry.”
[narrator] The beggar only shrugged and sank back into his rags, muttering curses under his breath. Holmes beckoned me aside.
[holmes] “You perceive, Watson, how the case grows darker. Here we have the undeniable presence of St. Clair, yet the only occupant of the house is this wretch. Are we to suppose that he murdered the man, and disposed of the body between the moment his wife cried out and the moment the constable entered? Impossible. And yet—what other hypothesis presents itself?”
[watson] “Could he have concealed the body somewhere near at hand? The river lies close—might it not have been cast into the water?”
[holmes] “A plausible thought, but it fails in one regard. The clothes are here. Why should a murderer trouble to strip his victim ere casting him into the Thames? No, Watson, there is a deeper artifice at work. We must return to Baker Street, and there, in the light of my study, arrange these facts in proper order. Only then shall we hope to pierce the mystery of the man with the twisted lip.”
[narrator] And so, leaving Boone in custody and the bewildered constable to his duties, we quitted the Bar of Gold and once more took to the cab. The streets were near deserted now, and the lamps burned low as we drove westward. Holmes, silent and absorbed, drew his cloak about him, while I turned the matter over in my own mind, only to find each conjecture ending in contradiction.
[narrator] At last, as the first pallor of dawn touched the eastern sky, we reached Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson had long since retired, and so we let ourselves in with a key. Holmes threw himself into his armchair, lit his pipe, and spread upon the table the array of evidence—the toy block, the garments, the pocket-book, and his own hasty notes. Then, leaning back, he steepled his fingers beneath his chin and closed his eyes.
[holmes] “Now, Watson, let us review. A gentleman of respectability disappears. His wife beholds him, as she believes, struggling at a window above an opium den. She raises the alarm. The room contains only a deformed beggar. The husband’s clothing is discovered, but not the man himself. There is no blood, no weapon, no trace of violence—save in the lady’s account. What explanation can encompass all?”
[watson] “Murder seems the most natural conclusion, yet you yourself dismiss it. Kidnapping, perhaps?”
[holmes] “To what end? A man of moderate fortune, no political significance, no known enemies. And yet, Watson—consider this. Why should the beggar Boone possess the outward signs of such prosperity? A room above a den, yes—but also sovereigns in his purse, a pipe of good quality, and—did you mark it?—the clean, well-kept nails of his hands. Strange, for one who lives in filth.”
[watson] “Indeed, I had not observed that.”
[holmes] “It is in such trifles that the truth reveals itself. I must pursue this line further. But first, we must rest. Sleep a few hours, my friend, and tomorrow we shall follow the twisted lip to its root.”
[narrator] Thus ended that long and bewildering night, though for myself, sleep came only in uneasy fragments, haunted by the image of Mrs. St. Clair’s pale face and the leering visage of the beggar Boone. Little did I know what revelations awaited us upon the morrow.
[narrator] The following day dawned grey and cheerless, with the fog hanging low over Baker Street like a heavy curtain. London, that restless giant, was stirring to life, but within the quiet walls of our sitting-room the world seemed suspended, awaiting the unraveling of the strange mystery that had so suddenly enmeshed us. Holmes had slept but briefly, rising with the first light, and I found him already immersed in chemical experiments, his sleeves rolled back and his sharp profile bent over a retort. A faint smell of acid mingled with the aroma of coffee Mrs. Hudson had contrived for us.
[watson] “Holmes, you astonish me. After such a night, one would expect you to rest. And here you are at your crucibles, as if a laboratory were more refreshing than a bed.”
[holmes] “Rest, my dear Watson, is a relative thing. My mind was occupied, and until it has reached a point of resolution, the body refuses repose. Besides, a few hours suffice me where another man might require eight. But come—sit down. I have arranged matters in my thoughts, and would gladly submit them to your judgment.”
[narrator] I did as he bade me, settling into the familiar armchair opposite, while Holmes laid aside his retort and, pipe in hand, began to pace the carpet with that peculiar quick stride which marked his deepest concentration.
[holmes] “Let us begin with certainties. First: Neville St. Clair was unquestionably in the room above the Bar of Gold upon the evening in question. His wife saw him, and her recognition may be accepted as conclusive. Second: his clothing was found there, complete and in good order. Third: the only other person present was the beggar Boone. Fourth: no trace of violence was discovered. These are facts. Now, how are we to reconcile them?”
[watson] “The most natural supposition, surely, is that Boone murdered St. Clair and disposed of the body.”
[holmes] “You forget, Watson, that the constable entered within moments of Mrs. St. Clair’s alarm. Could a man commit murder, strip his victim, conceal or remove the body, and then resume his place upon the rags—all in so short an interval? Absurd. The hypothesis will not hold.”
[watson] “Then perhaps the body was hidden within the house?”
[holmes] “The police searched thoroughly. Unless we assume supernatural powers of concealment, the body is not there. Yet the garments are. Therefore, one of two conclusions must be drawn: either St. Clair left that room alive and by his own will, or else he never left it at all, but in a manner which defies our conventional categories.”
[narrator] I confess I shook my head at this, for such subtleties of reasoning are not native to my own mind.
[watson] “If he left alive, then why should he abandon his clothes? It is unthinkable.”
[holmes] “Quite so. And yet, Watson, look at Boone. You noted his appearance—the twisted lip, the wild hair, the rags. But did you note his hands?”
[watson] “You mentioned them last night. They were cleaner than one would expect.”
[holmes] “Precisely. The nails were well-shaped, the fingers tapering. Not the claws of a vagabond who scrabbles in the gutter, but the hands of a gentleman. That incongruity, my dear fellow, is the key. Boone is not what he seems.”
[narrator] Holmes spoke with that quiet certainty which made contradiction futile. He threw himself once more into his chair and blew a ring of smoke toward the ceiling.
[holmes] “Imagine, Watson, that a man of education and respectability should adopt, for purposes of his own, the disguise of a beggar. What then? He could earn a livelihood, escape recognition, and vanish at will into the city’s teeming crowds. Might not Boone be such a one?”
[watson] “But to what end? Why should a gentleman debase himself so horribly?”
[holmes] “That is the point we must discover. Yet I have already made one experiment toward it.”
[narrator] He rose, went to his desk, and drew forth a sheet of notepaper. Upon it were scrawled several lines in his bold, angular hand.
[holmes] “This morning I dispatched telegrams to certain agents of mine in the City, instructing them to gather intelligence upon the beggar Boone—where he stations himself, how long he has been known, what manner of life he leads. Their reports will reach me ere nightfall. Meanwhile, we must wait. In the interval, I propose we call once more upon Mrs. St. Clair, that we may learn whether any further intelligence has reached her.”
[narrator] Accordingly, after a hasty luncheon, we set forth again to Kentish Town. The weather had turned drizzling, and the streets were splashed with puddles. Mrs. St. Clair received us with anxious eagerness, though her face was somewhat less stricken than on the previous night.
[mrs_stclair] “Oh, Mr. Holmes, you are kind to come. I have heard nothing since I last saw you. My heart tells me that Neville is still alive, yet the uncertainty is torture.”
[holmes] “You may trust, madam, that no effort shall be spared. Permit me a few questions. Your husband, I understand, is in the habit of going daily to the City?”
[mrs_stclair] “Yes, sir, though his business is of a private sort. He has dealings in shares and such matters, and keeps an office in the Square.”
[holmes] “Did you ever observe aught unusual in his comings or goings? Any acquaintances of whom you disapproved? Any hint that he lived a double life?”
[mrs_stclair] “Never! He was the most affectionate of husbands, the most devoted of fathers. He had no secrets from me—at least, so I believed.”
[watson] “You mentioned yesterday that he carried a child’s toy—the wooden block stained with blood. Was that indeed the same which you saw?”
[mrs_stclair] “Oh yes, Doctor. I gave it him myself, not an hour before he left the house. He placed it in his pocket, saying that our little one should have it at bedtime. To see it returned to me in such a condition—it was dreadful.”
[holmes] “And on the day of his disappearance, was there anything unusual in his manner?”
[mrs_stclair] “He was cheerful as always. Nothing gave me cause for alarm.”
[narrator] Holmes listened with grave attention, making brief notes in his pocket-book. When she had finished, he rose and bowed with the utmost courtesy.
[holmes] “You have aided us greatly, madam. Be assured, the truth is nearer than you think. Watson and I will pursue the inquiry further, and I hope ere long to bring you tidings more certain than hope or fear.”
[narrator] We took our leave, and as we walked back toward the main road, I could not refrain from voicing my perplexity.
[watson] “Holmes, the matter grows only darker. The wife swears to her husband’s character and to her own vision of him at the window. Yet all material evidence points only to Boone. How can the two be reconciled?”
[holmes] “By assuming that they are not two, but one.”
[narrator] I stared at him in astonishment.
[watson] “You mean—that Boone is Neville St. Clair himself?”
[holmes] “Exactly so.”
[watson] “But Holmes—that is monstrous! Why should a gentleman voluntarily assume such a loathsome disguise?”
[holmes] “That, Watson, is the very question which makes the case so singular. Yet remember—the evidence fits. The clean hands, the sovereigns, the pipe of quality, the well-furnished room. These are not the belongings of a vagabond. They belong to a man who plays at vagabondage. And what is more profitable in London than the trade of a professional beggar? Boone has been seen daily upon the streets, and it is whispered that his takings exceed those of many a merchant. Suppose, then, that Neville St. Clair, for reasons of his own, has for years maintained this double existence—respectable gentleman by day, mendicant by evening. Last night, his wife stumbled upon his secret. Her cry brought the police. He had but moments to effect his transformation. He thrust his clothes aside, and appeared as Boone. It is a bold theory—but consider how well it answers all difficulties.”
[narrator] I was struck dumb, for the audacity of the idea left me at once bewildered and convinced.
[watson] “It is incredible—and yet, as you state it, I can scarce resist believing. And yet—how to prove it?”
[holmes] “Proof is what we shall seek. Boone is in custody. I have but to obtain certain cosmetic reagents, and we shall see what lies beneath that twisted lip.”
[narrator] Holmes’s words thrilled me, for I knew that some decisive revelation was near. We returned to Baker Street, where the remainder of the afternoon was spent in impatient expectation. At length, as dusk fell, there came the sound of wheels, and a messenger arrived bearing several envelopes. Holmes tore them open eagerly, scanning the contents with a gleam of triumph.
[holmes] “It is as I suspected! Boone has been known these seven years at the corner of Threadneedle Street, and is reputed to make his two pounds a day. Yet no one knows where he goes at night. Some say he has a lodging in Stepney, others that he vanishes into the river fog. No beggar of his class ever handled so much coin. Watson, the case is solved in all but the formal proof.”
[watson] “And that proof—?”
[holmes] “We shall obtain it tonight. Come, the Yard awaits us. Bring your revolver, though I think we shall need no force beyond a pair of sharp eyes and a bottle of spirits.”
[narrator] And so, as night closed once more upon London, we set forth with renewed vigor, bound for the police-station where Boone, the man with the twisted lip, awaited the final stroke of Holmes’s deduction.
[narrator] The night was heavy with fog when we left Baker Street, the lamps along the thoroughfare glowing faintly like beacons half-lost in a sea of grey. Holmes was in a state of quiet but intense excitement, his long fingers twitching restlessly upon his cane, his eyes gleaming with that peculiar fire which betrayed the near approach of discovery. I, for my part, felt a mingling of eagerness and unease, for though I had come to trust his instincts implicitly, the notion that a respectable gentleman could also be a loathsome beggar seemed almost beyond the bounds of human credulity.
[narrator] Our cab bore us swiftly eastward to Bow Street, where Boone was confined. The police, accustomed now to Holmes’s interventions, admitted us without demur. We were ushered into a plain chamber, lit by a single oil-lamp, where at a table sat Inspector Bradstreet, a burly officer of frank and genial manner. Beside him, slouched in his chair, was the miserable figure of Boone, his twisted mouth contorted in a sneer, his eyes darting from one to another of us with sullen defiance.
[bradstreet] “Good evening, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson. I thought it but fair to let you have a look at our prisoner. He’s as obstinate as a mule, won’t give us a word beyond his name. What’s more, we’ve no charge to hold him on, save suspicion. If we can’t prove aught against him, he’ll walk free in the morning.”
[holmes] “That would be a pity, Inspector, for I believe this man’s true identity to be of the first importance. If you will grant me a few minutes alone with him, I promise you the strangest transformation you have ever witnessed within these walls.”
[boone] (snarling) “Transformation, is it? You may waste your time, sir, but I am what I am—a poor cripple with a cursed lip, and that’s the end of it.”
[holmes] “We shall see. Inspector, with your leave, I should like a basin of warm water, a bar of soap, and a small bottle of spirits of hartshorn. You may add a towel, if you are so disposed.”
[bradstreet] (laughing) “By George, Mr. Holmes, this grows curious indeed. Very well. You shall have your wish.”
[narrator] The required items were soon brought, and Holmes set them neatly upon the table. He removed his coat, rolled back his sleeves, and regarded the prisoner with an expression at once cold and commanding.
[holmes] “Now, Boone—or should I say Neville St. Clair?—let us dispense with pretence. You have played your part admirably, but the curtain must fall. Will you reveal yourself, or must I do it for you?”
[narrator] At the sound of his true name, Boone started violently. For an instant, his eyes betrayed panic; then he folded his arms with affected composure.
[boone] “You talk nonsense, sir. I never heard that name before.”
[holmes] “So be it. Watson, kindly hold the basin.”
[narrator] With that, Holmes seized the man’s chin in his firm grasp, heedless of his struggles, and began vigorously to scrub the distorted lip with the soapy cloth. The prisoner writhed and cursed, but Holmes’s grip was unyielding. Presently, with a few rapid motions and a dash of the sharp-smelling spirits, the grime and pigment yielded, and the hideous leer faded. Beneath the twisted mouth appeared the well-formed features of a man of education and refinement. The coarse hair was dragged away to reveal a smooth brow, and the rags seemed suddenly incongruous upon a body that bore itself with the instinctive carriage of a gentleman.
[narrator] Inspector Bradstreet sprang to his feet with an exclamation of amazement.
[bradstreet] “By Heaven! It is St. Clair himself!”
[watson] I too was struck speechless, for there before us sat, trembling and abashed, the very image of the missing gentleman whom we had sought in vain. The transformation was so complete, so astounding, that for a moment I could scarce believe my eyes.
[mr_stclair] “Gentlemen, I will confess. Resistance is useless. You have torn from me the secret I had hoped to guard to my grave. Yes, I am Neville St. Clair, though in this garb I am better known as Hugh Boone.”
[holmes] “It is well, sir, that you acknowledge the truth. Your wife’s distress has been grievous, and it is our duty to set her mind at rest. You owe us, therefore, a full and frank account of your strange deception.”
[narrator] St. Clair buried his face in his hands for a moment, then raised it with an expression of mingled shame and resignation.
[mr_stclair] “You shall know all. There is nothing criminal in my conduct, save the deceit of a double life. When first I came to London, I found myself with modest means and no certain prospect. One day, in a spirit of idle curiosity, I disguised myself as a beggar and took a seat upon the steps of the Exchange. To my amazement, I received more alms in a single day than I could have earned in a week by honest labour. The temptation proved too strong. I perfected my disguise, altered my lip with a twist of wax and pigment, and soon found that I could command an income such as many a merchant might envy. By day, I lived as Neville St. Clair, a gentleman of respectability. By evening, I became Boone, the crippled mendicant, haunting the thoroughfares and filling my purse with the careless charity of passers-by.”
[watson] “But sir—surely you felt shame at such a deception?”
[mr_stclair] “At first, Doctor, I did indeed. Yet the gold was heavy in my pocket, and as the years passed, I grew accustomed to the part. I told myself that I wronged no man, that I but accepted what they freely gave. And in truth, I prospered. I built my house in Kentish Town, I married, I became a father. None suspected, save the wretched lascar who let me the room above his den, where I might transform myself unseen.”
[holmes] “And last night?”
[mr_stclair] “Ah, last night was my undoing. I had donned my disguise as usual, and was in the act of changing in the room above the Bar of Gold, when suddenly I heard my wife’s voice in the street below. She had seen me at the window ere I could withdraw. In my panic, I dragged myself back, closed the sash, and flung off my gentleman’s clothes. At that instant, the constable burst in. I had but a moment to thrust the garments aside and resume the semblance of Boone. They found me thus, and I held stubbornly to the part. I never dreamed that Holmes would pierce the veil so swiftly.”
[holmes] “And the blood upon the toy block?”
[mr_stclair] “A trifle. I had cut my finger as I strove in haste to conceal my appearance. The toy was in my pocket, and so it was stained. I swear, there was no violence, no crime, save my own duplicity.”
[narrator] Inspector Bradstreet shook his head in astonishment.
[bradstreet] “Well, I’ll be bound! In all my days, I’ve never seen the like. To think that a respectable gentleman should masquerade thus! But as no crime has been committed, save a fraud upon the public, I cannot hold you further. You are free, sir—though I daresay you’ll find your reputation in peril should this tale become known.”
[mr_stclair] “Inspector, Mr. Holmes, Doctor Watson—I implore you, keep this secret from the world. My wife and children—let them not suffer for my folly. I give you my word, I shall never again don this loathsome garb.”
[narrator] Holmes regarded him sternly for a moment, then softened.
[holmes] “Your punishment, sir, lies in the shame you feel, and in the confidence you have betrayed. I shall not add to it by public exposure. The truth shall remain among ourselves, provided you keep your oath. Go, then, and live henceforth as Neville St. Clair, the honest gentleman. But remember—the eye of conscience is sharper than mine, and it will follow you wheresoever you go.”
[narrator] St. Clair bowed his head in silent gratitude, and the matter was thus concluded. Yet as we quitted the police-station and stepped once more into the foggy street, I could not refrain from expressing my wonder.
[watson] “Holmes, this is the strangest case we have yet encountered. Who could have believed that a man would lead so double a life, and for so base a reason?”
[holmes] “It is but another proof, Watson, that truth is ever stranger than fiction. The world is full of masks and deceptions, and it is the task of the detective to tear them away. In this instance, the mask was literal, and the truth lay beneath a smear of pigment and a twist of wax. Elementary, once the clue was grasped. But to Mrs. St. Clair, the truth will be joy, and that, I think, is satisfaction enough.”
[narrator] We rode back to Baker Street in thoughtful silence, while the city slumbered beneath its pall of mist. And thus ended the case of The Man with the Twisted Lip—a case which, for sheer singularity of circumstance, stands unmatched in my long association with Sherlock Holmes.
[narrator] The fog had lifted somewhat by the time we returned to Baker Street, though the air was still damp with the lingering breath of the Thames. Holmes, silent and contemplative, hung his coat upon the peg, lit the lamp, and flung himself into his familiar chair by the fire. I followed, sinking wearily into my accustomed seat. The events of the last hours—the confrontation, the revelation, the strange confession—still weighed heavily upon my mind.
[watson] “Holmes, I can scarcely believe it even now. To think that a man could live such a double life, and that beneath the tatters of a beggar there should lurk a respectable gentleman! It is as though one of Dickens’s tales had sprung to life before our very eyes.”
[holmes] “You are right, Watson, it is a tale for the penny magazines. Yet it illustrates a principle I have long held—that appearances are but the surface of things, and that beneath the mask of poverty may lie the craft of wealth, even as beneath the guise of wealth may lurk the cunning of crime. In short, we must reason from facts, not from preconceptions.”
[narrator] He leaned back, the smoke from his pipe wreathing about his ascetic features.
[holmes] “You see, the case was not truly so impenetrable as it appeared. There was no murder, no abduction, no supernatural disappearance. Merely a clever disguise, sustained by long practice. The clean hands betrayed him, the sovereigns gave him away, and the speed with which he transformed himself in that chamber was the final proof. All was elementary—once one permitted oneself to think of the possibility.”
[watson] “And yet, Holmes, do you not feel some measure of pity for the man? His shame, his secrecy, the terror of exposure—must it not have weighed upon him heavily through the years?”
[holmes] “No doubt, Watson. But pity is not my trade. I concern myself with truth, and it is for the man himself to reckon with conscience. Still, I am not inhuman. I agreed to keep his secret, for the sake of his innocent wife and children. Their happiness outweighs the satisfaction of public justice in this instance. Let the man bury Boone with his own hands, and may Neville St. Clair henceforth walk an honest road.”
[narrator] For a time we sat in silence, the fire crackling softly in the grate. I thought of Mrs. St. Clair, waiting even now in her little villa at Kentish Town, her heart torn between dread and hope. At length I could bear it no longer.
[watson] “Holmes, surely we should carry her the tidings at once. It is cruel to let her pass another hour in uncertainty.”
[holmes] “Spoken like a true doctor, Watson—ever with an eye to the patient’s suffering. Very well. We shall go together. A cab will take us swiftly, and perhaps you may play the herald of glad news.”
[narrator] And so, despite the lateness of the hour, we set forth once more. The streets were quieter now, the lamps burning low, but the city never sleeps entirely. Soon we stood once more before the modest villa. Holmes bade me be the one to knock, and when Mrs. St. Clair herself answered, candle in hand, her face pale with long vigils, I took her trembling hand in mine.
[watson] “Madam, be comforted. Your husband lives and is safe. His absence was not the work of violence, but of his own most singular deception. He will return to you this very night, penitent and resolved to cast off forever the mask which has so tormented you. All is well.”
[narrator] At these words she uttered a cry of joy, and the candle nearly fell from her grasp. Tears streamed down her cheeks as she pressed my hand to her lips.
[mrs_stclair] “Oh, Doctor, you bring me back to life! Tell me no more—I ask no questions. If Neville lives and will return, that is all I need. God bless you, and God bless Mr. Holmes!”
[narrator] We left her thus, her heart lightened, her candle held high as though it were the lamp of hope itself. Holmes said nothing as we re-entered the cab, but his eyes softened, and I thought I perceived in him a rare glow of satisfaction.
[narrator] Back at Baker Street, as dawn broke pale and wan across the housetops, Holmes stretched himself upon the sofa and closed his eyes.
[holmes] “Another case concluded, Watson. Strange, grotesque, perhaps even sordid—but instructive. Let it stand in your notes as an example of the power of disguise, and of the folly of assuming that poverty must always be genuine. There is no such school of imposture as London itself. It breeds deceits in every alley, and it is our task to tear away the mask, whether it hides crime or folly.”
[watson] “I shall set it down faithfully, Holmes. And though some may find it less sensational than murder or conspiracy, I venture to think that readers will find it no less remarkable.”
[holmes] (smiling faintly) “Then my work has not been in vain. For if the tale instructs one mind, sharpens one perception, or lifts one veil of ignorance, it has served its purpose. And now, Watson, to bed. The next telegram may summon us to some fresh absurdity, and we must be ready.”
[narrator] Thus ended the adventure of The Man with the Twisted Lip. It left upon my mind a deep impression—not only of the strange ingenuity of Holmes’s reasoning, but of the capacity of human nature for deception. In my practice as a physician, I had seen men conceal sickness, women conceal sorrow, and children conceal mischief; but never until this case had I known a man conceal himself so completely, that even his wife, the partner of his hearth and heart, was blind to the truth.
[narrator] It taught me, too, that in Holmes’s philosophy there was more than cold logic. Beneath his keen deductions lay a thread of mercy, a willingness to temper justice with compassion when the innocent might suffer by too rigid an application of law. That, perhaps, was the truest revelation of all.
[narrator] And so I close this record, as the lamps of Baker Street fade into memory, and the figure of my friend stands once more before me—lean, ascetic, pipe in hand, his eyes alight with that flame of intellect which burned so steadily, and which cast its glow upon many a darkened corner of the human soul.
