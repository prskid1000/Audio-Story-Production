1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,219
The vein was falling with a soft but steady persistence upon the gaslit streets of London.

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,540
That vast and shadowed city which seemed to brood eternally beneath its pall of smoke and mystery.

3
00:00:09,919 --> 00:00:15,679
It was upon such a night, damp and sullen, that I, Dr. John Watson, was summoned from my own

4
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:21,059
domestic peace into an adventure whose strange turns and startling revelations yet linger in

5
00:00:21,059 --> 00:00:26,120
my memory with singular vividness. I shall set it down faithfully here, in the hope that those

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:31,359
who follow the exploits of my friend Mr. Sherlock Holmes may find interest in the peculiar case of

7
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,160
the man with the twisted lip. I must begin by confessing that my own role at the outset was

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:42,760
quite unconnected to any investigation. Rather, it was the simple call of friendship and duty

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:47,520
which led me forth into the night. My dear wife, perceiving my concern for a patient who had

10
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,920
slipped grievously in her battle against the malady of opium, had urged me to attend her

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,600
even at this late hour, and thus, cloaked and gloved against the damp,

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,460
I made my way to the dismal quarter of the city, known as the East End,

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:02,660
where the narrow streets were lined with gin shops and opium dens,

14
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,200
and where the law held but a feeble dominion.

15
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,659
I recall thinking, as I walked beneath the dripping eaves,

16
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,460
how different is this world from that of Baker Street,

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,599
where Holmes sits by his fire, cold pipe in hand,

18
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,040
marshalling the facts of some intricate case.

19
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:20,760
Here, the tragedy is of a humbler, but no less ruinous sort,

20
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:26,439
the slow poisoning of body and soul. At length I came to the squalid house known to me as one of

21
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:32,420
ill-repute, where men of all classes, sailors, beggars, and even gentlemen in disguise sought

22
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,040
escape from reality in the deadly fumes of the poppy, with some reluctance I entered,

23
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,200
and found myself amidst the low murmur of voices, the reek of opium, and the dim gimmer of lambs

24
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,180
hung askew upon the peeling walls. The keeper of the den, a lasker of sinister appearance,

25
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,900
greeted me with a knowing smile,

26
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,300
as though accustomed to the sight of respectable men

27
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,280
slinking into his pit of degradation.

28
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:56,440
I inquired after my patient

29
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,240
and was soon led to the corner

30
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,520
where she lay half-conscious upon a tat-

31
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,480
red couch,

32
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,580
having ascertained her condition

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:05,180
and given what aid I could.

34
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,400
I was about to depart

35
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,680
when my eye was caught by a familiar figure

36
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,700
seated in the shadow,

37
00:02:09,939 --> 00:02:11,100
his long limbs stretched,

38
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,219
his deer-stalker hat pulled low upon his brow.

39
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,319
Holmes, I exclaimed,

40
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,900
scarcely believing my senses.

41
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,939
What in heaven's name are you doing here,

42
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:21,120
in a place like this?

43
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,539
His thin lips curled into a faint smile

44
00:02:24,539 --> 00:02:28,159
as he drew me nearer with a slight motion of the hand.

45
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:30,859
Hush, Watson, your voice may carry.

46
00:02:31,259 --> 00:02:34,799
I am engaged upon an inquiry of considerable delicacy,

47
00:02:35,219 --> 00:02:37,500
and this den is, for the moment,

48
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,979
the very heart of my investigation.

49
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:42,659
But surely, surely such a place is beneath

50
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:44,099
even your most singular methods.

51
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:47,400
What can you hope to learn here amidst this degradation?

52
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:54,280
Elementary, my dear fellow, crime, like disease, must be traced to its breeding grounds.

53
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:03,799
And here, amongst the smoke and the whispers, men reveal truths they would never speak in the bright light of the strand.

54
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,359
But come, your arrival is not ill-timed. There is more afoot tonight than either of us expected.

55
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:18,280
He rose swiftly, and with that peculiar energy, which seemed always to animate him in the pursuit of a case,

56
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,760
he guided me from the den and into the street.

57
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,000
The rain had slackened, but the cobblestones gleamed with a treacherous sheen.

58
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,360
A handsome cab was waiting at the corner, its horse stamping impatiently.

59
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,120
Quickly, Watson, a lady of your acquaintance has need of you, and by extension, of me.

60
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:38,340
We go to Kentish Town. There is no time to lose.

61
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,500
Perplexed but obedient, I climbed into the cab beside him.

62
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:47,340
The horse sprang forward and the damp night air rushed past as Holmes, ever composed,

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,699
produced his clay pipe and filled it with his black shag tobacco.

64
00:03:50,699 --> 00:03:57,280
He puffed once or twice, then turned to me with that piercing gaze which seemed to look to a man's very soul.

65
00:03:58,039 --> 00:04:02,319
Tell me at once what this is about, Holmes. You speak of a lady of my acquaintance. Who can it be?

66
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,719
It is none other than Mrs. St. Clair, the wife of the respectable gentleman of the city.

67
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:14,919
She is, at this very moment, in a state of the most acute agitation.

68
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:23,759
She believes her husband has been foully used in the neighbourhood of that very opium den we have just quitted.

69
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:30,759
Her message reached me not an hour ago, and knowing that your medical obligations might draw you eastward,

70
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,259
Eastward, I took the liberty of seeking you there.

71
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:37,800
The case, Watson, promises to be one of those puzzles

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
where the outward appearance is grotesque

73
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,800
and the inward truth stranger still.

74
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:43,620
Ah?

75
00:04:44,379 --> 00:04:47,180
Mr. St. Clair, I do not recall having met the man.

76
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,180
He is a person of good repute,

77
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,899
engaged in certain mercantile ventures

78
00:04:52,899 --> 00:04:54,819
and known for his probity.

79
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:57,699
Yet it is in connection with him

80
00:04:57,699 --> 00:05:02,319
that we shall find ourselves in the very thick of London's underworld,

81
00:05:02,819 --> 00:05:09,019
and perhaps face a deception so bold that even I must take care to untangle it.

82
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:13,360
Thus did Holmes tantalize me with hints, but no more, hey, Sibol,

83
00:05:13,659 --> 00:05:16,539
until at last we reached the modest residence in Kentish Town.

84
00:05:16,659 --> 00:05:18,480
The cab drew up before a neat little villa,

85
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,779
where a light still burned in the window despite the late hour.

86
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,800
As we entered, we were greeted by a lady whose pale countenance and trembling hands

87
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,120
betrayed her distress.

88
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:30,180
Oh, Mr. Holmes,

89
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:31,960
thank heaven you have come.

90
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,960
And you too, Dr. Watson.

91
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,199
You are both most kind.

92
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,680
I am nearly beside myself with dread

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,840
for I know not whether my husband

94
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,400
be alive or dead.

95
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:46,800
Holmes bowed with his accustomed courtesy,

96
00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:49,120
but his eyes missed nothing.

97
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,620
The disorder of the room,

98
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,000
the hastily discarded shawl,

99
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:56,220
the anxious glances toward the door.

100
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,560
Compose yourself, madam.

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,160
You have sent for us to aid you, and aid you we shall.

102
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,980
But you must give us every particular without reservation.

103
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Yes, yes, I shall tell you all.

104
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,019
My husband, Neville Sinclair, set out this morning for the city.

105
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:20,420
He is a most punctual man, and never has he failed to return by evening to his supper.

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,500
Yet today he did not come.

107
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,040
In my anxiety, I took it upon myself to go in search of him.

108
00:06:27,579 --> 00:06:31,379
I knew that his business would take him through the east end

109
00:06:31,379 --> 00:06:35,519
and so I made my way there, though it is a place I dread.

110
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:40,800
She shuddered and I offered her a glass of water,

111
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,120
which she accepted dreadfully before continuing.

112
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:49,540
It was near to the riverside, in that vile quarter where the opium dens abound,

113
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:55,300
that I saw him, or thought I saw him, at a window above the sign of the bar of gold.

114
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,900
He was leaning out, and for an instant I caught his face in the lamplight.

115
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:08,160
I cried out to him, but in that very moment he seemed to be dragged back violently as though by some unseen hand,

116
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,040
and then the window was closed, and I saw him no more.

117
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:15,920
Good Lord! That is most sinister indeed.

118
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,820
Pray continue, madam, what followed.

119
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:24,720
I rushed to the place at once, but the last car who keeps the establishment would not admit me.

120
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,020
I was near to fainting when a constable came by, and to him I explained my plight.

121
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:36,960
Together we forced our way inside, but there was no sign of my husband,

122
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:44,040
only a most hideous creature, a beggar with a twisted lip sat, crouched among the pillows.

123
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,180
The constable searched him, and found upon his person a few coins and a letter,

124
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,759
and here, here is the last terrible proof.

125
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,500
With trembling hands she drew from her bosom

126
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:56,300
a small parcel wrapped in paper.

127
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,500
She unfolded it and to our astonishment

128
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,360
there fell upon the table a child's toy,

129
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,280
a wooden block with letters upon it,

130
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,280
smeared with blood.

131
00:08:03,439 --> 00:08:04,780
I recognized it instantly,

132
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,360
for my own children had such playthings.

133
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,180
It is my son's.

134
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,660
Neville carried it with him this morning

135
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:14,180
to amuse the little one when he returned home.

136
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,600
And now it is stained thus.

137
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:19,240
Oh, Mr. Holmes, what can it mean?

138
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:25,820
Holmes took up the toy, examined it minutely, and then set it down.

139
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:31,580
His face was inscrutable, yet his eyes gleamed with that light I knew so well,

140
00:08:31,939 --> 00:08:34,740
the light of fierce intellectual engagement.

141
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:38,920
We must go at once to the Bar of Gold, Watson.

142
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:44,759
The night is not yet spent, and if there is truth to be learned, it lies there.

143
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:48,439
Mrs. St. Clair caught his sleep with desperate urgency.

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:53,980
Promise me, Mr. Holmes, promise me that you will bring him back to me,

145
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:59,679
dead or alive, only do not leave me in this torment of uncertainty.

146
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:05,139
I promise, madam, that I shall leave no stone unturned in my search.

147
00:09:05,659 --> 00:09:10,740
Whether your husband lives or has met some darker fate, you shall have the truth.

148
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:16,279
And so, without delay, Holmes and I once more plunged into the labyrinth of London by night,

149
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,100
the case unfolding before us like some dreadful enigma whose solution would test even the limits

150
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:26,600
of his remarkable genius. The handsome cab rattled swiftly over the cobbles as Holmes and I sped

151
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,159
once more toward the east end. The hour was late, and most respectable citizens were long abed,

152
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:36,220
yet the darker quarters of London seemed to grow only more animated. Women of dishevelled attire

153
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,620
coiled from shadowed doorways, while drunken sailors wheeled arm in arm, singing coarse

154
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:45,180
songs beneath the dripping lamps. A chill wind rose from the river, carrying with it the mingled

155
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:50,500
odours of tar, smoke and decay. Holmes, seated opposite me, remained in profound concentration,

156
00:09:50,899 --> 00:09:55,300
his eyes half closed, the toy block turning slowly in his lean fingers as though it held

157
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,620
some secret known only to him. Holmes, do you truly believe Neville St. Clair was abducted

158
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:06,299
before his wife's very eyes, the idea chins the blood. And yet, might she not have been deceived

159
00:10:06,299 --> 00:10:12,279
by some resemblance, some figure seen dimly through the lamplight? My dear Watson, I never

160
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:19,480
permit myself the luxury of premature conclusions. Whether Mrs. St. D'Ere, Clare's testimony is

161
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:27,220
accurate or not, it is an essential fact that she herself believes it true. That alone renders it of

162
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:33,540
value. Our task is to separate the certain from the conjectural, the proved from the imagined.

163
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,600
And for that, we must examine the bar of gold for ourselves.

164
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,980
At length, the cab drew up beside a crooked alley which sloped down toward the thins.

165
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:50,540
There, beneath a weathered signboard depicting a gilded chalice, stood the squalid den which

166
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,300
had already played so sinister a part in the day's events. Soon, a solitary lamp flickered

167
00:10:55,299 --> 00:11:00,319
above its door, throwing a fitful glow upon the wet pavement, the Lasker keeper, with his

168
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:06,639
turban askew, regarded us with sullen suspicion as we entered. Good evening. You recall me,

169
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:13,479
no doubt. I was here earlier tonight. Yes, Sahib, I remember. But there is nothing here for you now.

170
00:11:13,659 --> 00:11:19,779
No trouble tonight. That remains to be seen. My companion and I shall have a look about.

171
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,319
Do not trouble yourself to follow us.

172
00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:54,740
window overlooking the alley. Holmes crossed at once to that window and examined the sill with

173
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,679
his magnifying lens. The rain had washed it clean, yet I saw him nod with satisfaction as he traced

174
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:06,059
some faint mark invisible to my eye. Watson, observe here. Though the paint is blistered,

175
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:12,319
there remains the smudge of a hand. Rest hard against the wood, and see here fibres

176
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,820
quarked upon the latch.

177
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,920
The window was not merely closed,

178
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,120
but shut in great haste.

179
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:20,660
I do not doubt

180
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,500
Mrs. St. Clair's account.

181
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,440
A husband was indeed here.

182
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,620
But if so, where is he now,

183
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,020
and by whom was he seized?

184
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,500
That, my friend,

185
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,560
is the riddle

186
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,200
we are come to answer.

187
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,840
Yet consider,

188
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,180
the lady described a man

189
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,440
with a twisted lip.

190
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,120
Such a person

191
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,840
is not easily forgotten.

192
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Let us see what manner of fellow he may be.

193
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:52,120
As though in answer to Holmes' words, the door opened and Constable Barton, a stout young officer,

194
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,180
entered the chamber, his lantern casting long shadows upon the walls.

195
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,379
Good evening, Mr. Holmes. Doctor, you come in good time.

196
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,260
The fellow is secured below and awaits your inspection.

197
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,600
Excellent. And what have you found here?

198
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,720
Nothing of Mr. St. Clair, sir, save for this.

199
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,139
He held up a bundle of clothes, neatly folded, and undeniably of good quality.

200
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:19,040
Within the coat pocket dimmered a handful of sovereigns,

201
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:22,340
and in the waistcoat lay a pocketbook bearing the name Neville St. Sane.

202
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:23,259
Claire.

203
00:13:24,139 --> 00:13:29,580
It is his beyond all doubt, and yet how should his garments be here while he himself has vanished?

204
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,440
A question worthy of our utmost attention.

205
00:13:34,019 --> 00:13:37,160
But let us first behold the occupant of this chamber.

206
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:39,639
I then said, Anved Daya.

207
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,980
We descended once more and were conducted to a corner where,

208
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:47,519
upon a heap of rags, crouched as loathsome a creature as ever I beheld.

209
00:13:47,699 --> 00:13:50,159
His face was twisted into a perpetual leer,

210
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:54,079
his lip drawn awry so as to expose a row of yellow teeth.

211
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:57,419
Kutishing, a mass of unkempt hair hung about his brow

212
00:13:57,419 --> 00:14:00,559
and his small eyes glittered with mingled fear and defiance.

213
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:03,500
He clutched a clay pipe in his claw-like hand

214
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:06,500
and when we approached, he snarled like some cornered animal.

215
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,240
Your name?

216
00:14:09,299 --> 00:14:12,199
They call me Boone, sir.

217
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:14,120
Hugh, Boone.

218
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,539
Under begging life I lead,

219
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,059
for there's little else for the likes of me.

220
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,860
You occupy this chamber?

221
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,759
Aye, and pay rent for it.

222
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,519
But you will not find your gentleman here.

223
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:29,379
I know nothing of him.

224
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,159
But his clothes were discovered above.

225
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:33,439
How do you explain that?

226
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,899
I cannot explain what I never saw.

227
00:14:35,899 --> 00:14:39,639
Maybe he left them, maybe someone blanted them.

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,579
All I know is that I mind my own trade, and no harm in it.

229
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,799
His voice was thick and guttural, his manner evasive.

230
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,740
Holmes regarded him with cool detachment,

231
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:53,699
though I could perceive the keen play of thought behind those sharp grey eyes.

232
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:57,840
You deny, then, any knowledge of Mr. Neville St. Clair?

233
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,299
And yet, Mrs. St. Clair?

234
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,340
Clair herself avers that she saw her husband at your window

235
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,800
this very evening.

236
00:15:07,060 --> 00:15:08,600
Then the lady is mistaken,

237
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:11,160
for no man has been here save me.

238
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:13,840
Holmes turned to the constable.

239
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,620
You have searched the premises thoroughly?

240
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,740
Every inch, sir.

241
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,660
No trace of the missing man,

242
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,680
alive or dead.

243
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:25,399
And yet here are his garments,

244
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:26,500
his pocketbook,

245
00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:27,879
his very rings.

246
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,879
Curious indeed.

247
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,780
Boon, you will remain in custody

248
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,160
until further inquiry.

249
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:39,399
The beggar only shrugged and sank back into his rags, muttering curses under his breath.

250
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:40,600
Holmes beckoned me aside.

251
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,000
You perceive, Watson, how the case grows darker.

252
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,399
Here we have the undeniable presence of Saint Seyn.

253
00:15:49,899 --> 00:15:54,160
Clare, yet the only occupant of the house is this wretch.

254
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:59,040
Are we to suppose that he murdered the man and disposed of the body

255
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,540
between the moment his wife cried out and the moment that Constable entered?

256
00:16:03,539 --> 00:16:08,500
Impossible! And yet what other hypothesis presents itself?

257
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,699
Could he have concealed the body somewhere near at hand?

258
00:16:12,059 --> 00:16:15,219
The river-lice clothes might not have been cast into the water?

259
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:20,199
A plausible thought, but it fails in one regard.

260
00:16:20,659 --> 00:16:21,980
The clothes are here.

261
00:16:22,379 --> 00:16:27,500
Why should a murderer trouble to strip his victim at casting him into the Thames?

262
00:16:28,039 --> 00:16:31,579
No, Watson, there is a deeper artifice at work.

263
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:34,120
we must return to Baker Street

264
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,900
and there in the light of my study

265
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,820
arrange these facts in proper order

266
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:41,700
only then shall we hope

267
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,740
to pierce the mystery of the man

268
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,040
with the twisted lip

269
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,300
and so leaving Boone in custody

270
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,320
and the bewildered constable to his duties

271
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,920
we quitted the bar of gold

272
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,280
and once more took to the cab

273
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,080
the streets were near deserted now

274
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,520
and the lamps burned low

275
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,680
as we drove westward

276
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,379
Holmes, siphoned and absorbed

277
00:16:58,379 --> 00:16:59,660
drew his cloak about him

278
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,160
while I turned the matter over

279
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:06,899
in my own mind, only to find each conjecture ending in contradiction. At last, as the first

280
00:17:06,899 --> 00:17:12,720
pallor of dawn touched the eastern sky, we reached Baker Street. Mrs. Hudson had long since retired,

281
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,960
and so we let ourselves in with a key. Holmes threw himself into his armchair, lit his pipe,

282
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:21,119
and spread upon the table the array of evidence, the toy block, the garments, the pocketbook,

283
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:26,779
and his own hasty notes. Then, leaning back, he steepled his fingers beneath his chin and closed

284
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:36,720
his eyes. Now, Watson, let us review. A gentleman of respectability disappears. His wife beholds him,

285
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:45,399
as she believes, straddling at a window above an opium den. She raises the alarm. The room

286
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:52,180
contains only a deformed beggar. The husband's clothing is discovered, but not the man himself.

287
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:59,140
There is no blood, no weapon, no trace of violence, save in the lady's account.

288
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,240
What explanation can encompass all?

289
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:08,060
Murder seems the most natural conclusion, yet you yourself dismiss it. Kidnapping, perhaps?

290
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,180
To what end? A man of moderate fortune, no political significance, no known enemies.

291
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,720
And yet, Watson, consider this.

292
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:22,539
Why should the beggar Boone possess the outward signs of such prosperity?

293
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:27,700
A room above a den, yes, but also sovereigns in his purse,

294
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:31,160
a pipe of good quality, and did you mark it?

295
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:37,860
The clean, well-kept nails of his hands, strange for one who lives in filth.

296
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:40,519
Indeed, I had not observed that.

297
00:18:40,519 --> 00:18:44,680
It is in such trifles that the truth reveals itself.

298
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,240
I must pursue this line further.

299
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,380
But first, we must rest.

300
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,660
Sleep a few hours, my friend,

301
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:55,100
and tomorrow we shall follow the twisted lip to its root.

302
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,980
Thus ended that long and bewildering night.

303
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,019
Though for myself, sleep came only in uneasy fragments,

304
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:04,039
haunted by the image of Mrs. St. Clair's pained face

305
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,340
and the leering visage of the beggar boon,

306
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:09,640
little did I know what revelations awaited us upon the morrow.

307
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,820
The following day dawned grey and cheerless,

308
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:16,519
with the fog hanging low over Baker Street, like a heavy curtain.

309
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:19,220
London, that restless giant, was stirring to life.

310
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,519
But within the quiet walls of our sitting room, the world seemed suspended,

311
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:26,599
awaiting the unravelling of the strange mystery that had so suddenly enmeshed us.

312
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:29,740
Holmes had slept, but briefly, rising with the first light.

313
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:32,399
And I found him already immersed in chemical experiments.

314
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,740
His sleeves rolled back and his sharp profile bent over a retort.

315
00:19:35,939 --> 00:19:40,599
A faint smell of acid mingled with the aroma of coffee Mrs. Hudson had contrived for us.

316
00:19:41,259 --> 00:19:42,539
Holmes, you astonish me.

317
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:44,899
After such a night, one would expect you to rest.

318
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,879
And here you are at your crucibles, as if a laboratory were more refreshing than a bed.

319
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,700
Rest, my dear Watson, is a relative thing.

320
00:19:54,139 --> 00:20:01,339
My mind was occupied, and until it has reached a point of resolution, the body refuses repose.

321
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:06,539
Besides, a few hours suffice me where another man might require aid.

322
00:20:06,859 --> 00:20:08,220
But come, sit down.

323
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:13,620
I have arranged matters in my thoughts and would gladly submit them to your judgment.

324
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,380
I did as he bade me, settling into the familiar armchair opposite,

325
00:20:18,759 --> 00:20:21,940
while Holmes laid aside his retort and, pipe in hand,

326
00:20:22,339 --> 00:20:27,059
began to pace the carpet with that peculiar quick stride which marked his deepest concentration.

327
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,900
Let us begin with certainties.

328
00:20:30,299 --> 00:20:31,819
First, Neville Sane.

329
00:20:31,819 --> 00:20:38,240
Claire was unquestionably in the room above the bar of gold upon the evening in question.

330
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:42,980
His wife saw him, and her recognition may be accepted as conclusive.

331
00:20:46,059 --> 00:20:51,039
Second, his clothing was found there, complete and in good order.

332
00:20:51,659 --> 00:20:55,599
Third, the only other person present was the beggar Boone.

333
00:20:56,059 --> 00:21:00,000
Fourth, no trace of violence was discovered. These are facts.

334
00:21:01,819 --> 00:21:05,460
Now, how are we to reconcile them?

335
00:21:07,299 --> 00:21:09,839
The most natural supposition, surely,

336
00:21:10,179 --> 00:21:13,179
is that Boone murdered St. Clair and disposed of the body.

337
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,559
You forget, Watson, that the constable entered

338
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,139
within moments of Mrs. St. Clair's alarm.

339
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,599
Could a man commit murder, strip his victim,

340
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,319
conceal or remove the body,

341
00:21:24,539 --> 00:21:26,759
and then resume his place upon the rags?

342
00:21:27,099 --> 00:21:28,839
All in so short an interval?

343
00:21:28,839 --> 00:21:32,159
Third, the hypothesis will not hold.

344
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,939
Then perhaps the body was hidden within the house?

345
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,119
The police searched thoroughly.

346
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,959
Unless we assume supernatural powers of concealment, the body is not there.

347
00:21:45,139 --> 00:21:46,919
Yet, the garments are.

348
00:21:47,259 --> 00:21:51,579
Therefore, one of two conclusions must be drawn, either saint.

349
00:21:52,139 --> 00:21:55,740
Clare left that room alive and by his own will,

350
00:21:55,740 --> 00:22:02,000
or else he never left it at all, but in a manner which defies our conventional categories.

351
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:08,579
I confess I shook my head at this, for such subtleties of reasoning are not native to my own mind.

352
00:22:09,339 --> 00:22:13,299
If he left alive, then why should he abandon his clothes? It is unthinkable.

353
00:22:14,279 --> 00:22:17,500
Quite so. And yet, Watson, look at Boone.

354
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:22,900
You noted his appearance, the twisted lick, the wild hair, the rags.

355
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,440
But did you note his hands?

356
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,240
You mentioned them last night. They were cleaner than one would expect.

357
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:33,920
Precisely. The nails were well-shaped, the fingers tapering.

358
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:40,019
Not the claws of a vagabond who scrabbles in the gutter, but the hands of a gentleman.

359
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:46,359
That incongruity, my dear fellow, is the key. Boon is not what he seems.

360
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:50,859
Holmes spoke with that quiet certainty, which made contradiction futile.

361
00:22:50,859 --> 00:22:55,759
Joke hai! He threw himself once more into his chair and blew a ring of smoke toward the ceiling.

362
00:22:56,699 --> 00:23:02,099
Imagine, Watson, that a man of education and respectability should adopt,

363
00:23:02,419 --> 00:23:06,079
if for purposes of his own, the disguise of a beggar.

364
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,139
What then? He could earn a livelihood, escape recognition,

365
00:23:11,619 --> 00:23:15,319
and vanish at will into the city's teeming crowds.

366
00:23:15,719 --> 00:23:17,639
Might not Boone be such a one?

367
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,980
But to what end? Why should a gentleman debase himself so horribly?

368
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:26,080
That is the point we must discover.

369
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:30,000
Yet I have already made one experiment toward it.

370
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:34,340
He rose, went to his desk and drew forth a sheet of notepaper.

371
00:23:34,759 --> 00:23:37,900
Upon it was scrawled several lines in his bold, angular hand.

372
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:42,600
This morning I dispatched telegrams to certain agents of mine in the city,

373
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:46,980
instructing them to gather intelligence upon the beggar.

374
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:54,860
Boone, where he stations himself, how long he has been known, what manner of life he leads.

375
00:23:55,660 --> 00:24:02,400
Their reports will reach me ere nightfall. Meanwhile, we must wait. In the interval,

376
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:09,520
I propose we call once more upon Mrs. Saints, Claire, that we may learn whether any further

377
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,840
intelligence has reached her. Accordingly, after a hasty luncheon, we set forth again to

378
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:18,079
Kentish town. The weather had turned drizzling

379
00:24:18,079 --> 00:24:20,159
and the streets were splashed with puddles.

380
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:22,059
Mrs. Saint-Saint Lair received

381
00:24:22,059 --> 00:24:23,980
us with anxious eagerness, though her

382
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,980
face was somewhat less stricken than on the

383
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,579
previous night.

384
00:24:27,439 --> 00:24:29,399
Oh, Mr. Holmes, you are kind to come.

385
00:24:29,779 --> 00:24:31,899
I have heard nothing since I last saw you.

386
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:33,919
My heart tells me

387
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,480
that Neville is still alive,

388
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:38,079
yet the uncertainty is torture.

389
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,079
You may trust,

390
00:24:42,079 --> 00:24:44,039
madam, that no effort shall be

391
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:52,680
spared. Permit me a few questions. Your husband, I understand, is in the habit of going daily to

392
00:24:52,680 --> 00:25:00,019
the city? Yes, sir, though his business is of a private sort. He has dealings in shares and such

393
00:25:00,019 --> 00:25:07,259
matters, and keeps an office in the square. Did you ever observe aught unusual in his comings

394
00:25:07,259 --> 00:25:09,119
or goings? Any

395
00:25:09,119 --> 00:25:11,180
acquaintances of whom you disapproved?

396
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,900
Any hint that he lived

397
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:14,039
a double life?

398
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:17,200
Never. He was the most affectionate of husbands,

399
00:25:17,319 --> 00:25:18,720
the most devoted of fathers.

400
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:21,319
He had no secrets from me,

401
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,359
at least so I believed.

402
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,279
You mentioned yesterday

403
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:26,839
that he carried a chai stoy,

404
00:25:27,119 --> 00:25:28,680
the wooden block stained with blood.

405
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,700
Was that indeed the same which you saw?

406
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,599
Oh yes, doctor.

407
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:35,160
I gave it him myself, not an

408
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,879
hour before he left the house.

409
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,840
He placed it in his pocket, saying that our little one should have it at bedtime.

410
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:46,380
To see it return to me in such a condition, it was dreadful.

411
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:53,580
And on the day of his disappearance, was there anything unusual in his manner?

412
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,200
He was cheerful as always. Nothing gave me cause for alarm.

413
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:02,300
Holmes listened with grave attention, making brief notes in his pocketbook.

414
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,680
When she had finished, he rose and bowed with the utmost courtesy.

415
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:11,960
You have aided us greatly, madam. Be assured the truth is nearer than you think.

416
00:26:12,519 --> 00:26:20,220
Watson and I will pursue the inquiry further, and I hope ere long to bring you tidings more certain than hope or fear.

417
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:26,019
We took our leave, and as we walked back toward the main road, I could not refrain from voicing my perplexity.

418
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:26,720
Huh!

419
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:34,180
Horns, the matter grows only darker. The wife swears to her husband's character and to her own vision of him at the window.

420
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:36,640
yet all material evidence points only to Boone.

421
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:38,320
How can the two be reconciled?

422
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:42,360
By assuming that they are not two, but one.

423
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,500
I stared at him in astonishment.

424
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:47,759
You mean that Boone is Neville St. Clair himself?

425
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,940
Ah, exactly so. Hmm.

426
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,940
But Holmes, that is monstrous.

427
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,140
Why should a gentleman voluntarily assume such a loathsome disguise?

428
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,759
That, Watson, is the very question which makes the case so singular.

429
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:04,640
Yet remember, the evidence fits.

430
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,920
The clean hands, the sovereigns, the pipe of quality, the well-furnished room.

431
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:14,180
These are not the belongings of a vagabond.

432
00:27:14,539 --> 00:27:17,720
They belong to a man who plays at vagabondage.

433
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:18,539
How?

434
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:23,379
And what is more profitable in London than the trade of a professional beggar?

435
00:27:24,079 --> 00:27:27,279
Boone has been seen daily upon the streets,

436
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:32,859
and it is whispered that his takings exceed those of many a merchant.

437
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,639
Suppose, then, that Neville's saint, Clare, for reasons of his own,

438
00:27:38,899 --> 00:27:41,639
has for years maintained this double existence,

439
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:45,960
respectable gentleman by day, mendicant by evening.

440
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:50,920
Last night his wife stumbled upon his secret.

441
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,879
Her cry brought the police.

442
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,160
He had but moments to effect his transformation.

443
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,460
He thrust his clothes aside and appeared as Boone.

444
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:05,160
It is a bold theory, but consider how well it answers all difficulties.

445
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:13,120
Whenever, Tampa, I was struck dumb for the audacity of the idea left me at once bewildered and convinced.

446
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:18,460
It is incredible, and yet, as you stated, I can scarce resist believing.

447
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,820
And yet, how to prove it?

448
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:23,460
Proof is what we shall seek.

449
00:28:24,019 --> 00:28:25,460
Boone is in custody.

450
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:32,519
I have but to obtain certain cosmetic reagents, and we shall see what lies beneath that twisted lip.

451
00:28:33,259 --> 00:28:37,240
Holmes' words thrilled me, for I knew that some decisive revelation was near.

452
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,779
We returned to Baker Street, where the remainder of the afternoon was spent in impatient expectation.

453
00:28:42,019 --> 00:28:48,420
At length, as dusk fell, there came the sound of wheels, and a messenger arrived bearing several envelopes.

454
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,440
Holmes tore them open eagerly, scanning the contents with a gleam of triumph.

455
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:59,059
It is as I suspected. Boone has been known these seven years at the corner of Threadneedle Street

456
00:28:59,059 --> 00:29:05,019
and is reputed to make his two pounds a day. Yet no one knows where he goes at night.

457
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:11,259
Some say he has a lodging in Stepney, others that he vanishes into the river fog.

458
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:19,840
No beggar of his class ever handled so much coin. Watson, the case is solved in all but the formal proof.

459
00:29:19,839 --> 00:29:21,659
And that proof?

460
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:24,039
We shall obtain it tonight

461
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,419
Come, the yard awaits us

462
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:27,579
Bring your revolver

463
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:29,559
Though I think we shall need no force

464
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:31,240
Beyond a pair of sharp eyes

465
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,659
And a bottle of spirits

466
00:29:32,659 --> 00:29:36,559
And so, as night closed once more upon London

467
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,259
We set forth with renewed vigour

468
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:39,539
Bound for the police station

469
00:29:39,539 --> 00:29:41,839
Where Boone, the man with the twisted lip

470
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,539
Awaited the final stroke of Holmes' deduction

471
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:46,579
The night was heavy with fog

472
00:29:46,579 --> 00:29:47,740
When we left Baker Street

473
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,459
Hide and piety

474
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:50,840
Asif, the lamps along the thoroughfare

475
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,539
Dewing faintly like beacons

476
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:54,100
Half lost in a sea of grey

477
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,600
Didi, Combs was in a state of quiet

478
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,819
But intense excitement

479
00:29:57,819 --> 00:30:00,740
His long fingers twitching restlessly upon his gain

480
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,059
His eyes gleaming with that peculiar fire

481
00:30:03,059 --> 00:30:05,400
Which betrayed the near approach of discovery

482
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,079
Hi, for my part

483
00:30:07,079 --> 00:30:09,019
Felt a mingling of eagerness and unease

484
00:30:09,019 --> 00:30:11,700
For though I had come to trust his instincts implicitly

485
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,819
The notion that a respectable gentleman

486
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:15,740
Could also be a loathsome beggar

487
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:18,440
Seemed almost beyond the bounds of human tradulity

488
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:21,519
Our cab bore us swiftly eastward to Bow Street

489
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:22,779
where Boone was confined

490
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,559
The police, accustomed now to Holmes' interventions

491
00:30:25,559 --> 00:30:27,320
admitted us without demur

492
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,420
We were ushered into a plain chamber

493
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:31,059
lit by a single oil lamp

494
00:30:31,059 --> 00:30:33,039
where at a table sat Inspector Bradstreet

495
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,519
a burly officer of frank and genuine manner

496
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,519
Beside him, slouched in his chair

497
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,259
was the miserable figure of Boone

498
00:30:39,259 --> 00:30:41,420
His twisted mouth contorted in a sneer

499
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:43,740
His eyes darting from one to another of us

500
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,759
with sullen defiance

501
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:46,299
Good evening, Mr. Holmes

502
00:30:46,299 --> 00:30:50,779
Dr. Watson, I thought it but fair to let you have a look at our prisoner.

503
00:30:51,139 --> 00:30:53,059
He's as obstinate as a mule.

504
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:55,240
Won't give us a word beyond his name.

505
00:30:55,579 --> 00:30:58,500
What's more, we've no charge to hold him on, save suspicion.

506
00:30:58,839 --> 00:31:02,139
If we can't prove art against him, he'll walk free in the morning.

507
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,079
That would be a pity, Inspector,

508
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,980
for I believe this man's true identity to be of the first importance.

509
00:31:10,440 --> 00:31:13,500
If you will grant me a few minutes alone with him,

510
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:19,779
I promise you the strangest transformation you have ever witnessed within these walls.

511
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:24,319
Gnarling transformation, is it?

512
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:30,680
You may waste your time, sir, but I am what I am.

513
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,720
A poor cripple with a cursed lip.

514
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,539
And that's the end of it.

515
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,259
We shall see.

516
00:31:39,259 --> 00:31:48,440
Inspector, with your leave, I should like a basin of warm water, a bar of soap, and a small bottle of spirits of heart horn.

517
00:31:48,879 --> 00:31:51,759
You may add a towel, if you are so disposed.

518
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,700
Laughing? By George, Mr. Holmes, this grows curious indeed.

519
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,920
Very well, you shall have your wish.

520
00:31:59,819 --> 00:32:03,579
The required items were soon brought, and Holmes set them meekly upon the table.

521
00:32:03,579 --> 00:32:09,679
He removed his coat, rolled back his sleeves and regarded the prisoner with an expression at once cold and commanding.

522
00:32:10,519 --> 00:32:15,879
Now Boone, or should I say Neville St. Clair, let us dispense with pretense.

523
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:20,699
You have played your part admirably, but the curtain must fall.

524
00:32:21,199 --> 00:32:24,199
Will you revere yourself or must I do it for you?

525
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:28,240
At the sound of his true name, Boone started violently.

526
00:32:28,779 --> 00:32:30,679
For an instant, his eyes betrayed panic.

527
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:33,019
Then he folded his arms with affected composure.

528
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:37,180
You talk nonsense, sir. I never heard that name before.

529
00:32:38,139 --> 00:32:41,180
So be it. Watson, kindly hold the basin.

530
00:32:41,839 --> 00:32:46,180
With that, Holmes seized the man's chin in his firm grasp, heedless of his struggles,

531
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:50,039
and began vigorously to scrub the distorted lip with the soapy cloth.

532
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:53,420
The prisoner writhed and cursed, but Holmes' grip was unyielding.

533
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:57,940
Presently, with a few rapid motions and a dash of the sharp-smelling spirits,

534
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,000
the grime and pigment yielded and the hideous layer faded.

535
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:06,440
Beneath the twisted mouth appeared the well-formed features of a man of education and refinement.

536
00:33:06,759 --> 00:33:09,319
The coarse hair was dragged away to reveal a smooth brow,

537
00:33:09,319 --> 00:33:14,839
and the rags seemed suddenly incongruous upon a body that bore itself with the instinctive carriage of a gentleman.

538
00:33:15,619 --> 00:33:19,240
Inspector Bradstreet sprang to his feet with an exclamation of amazement.

539
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,079
By heaven! It is St. Clair himself!

540
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:27,359
I too was struck speechless, for there before us sat, trembling and abashed,

541
00:33:27,359 --> 00:33:31,519
The very image of the missing gentleman whom we had sought in vain

542
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,359
The transformation was so complete, so astounding

543
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:37,240
That for a moment I could scarce believe my eyes

544
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:41,059
Gentlemen, I will confess, resistance is useless

545
00:33:41,059 --> 00:33:44,819
You are torn from me the secret I had hoped to guard to my grave

546
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:47,179
Yes, I am Neville St. Saint

547
00:33:47,179 --> 00:33:51,099
Claire, though in this garb I am better known as Hugh Boone

548
00:33:51,099 --> 00:33:54,519
It is well, sir, that you acknowledge the truth

549
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:57,119
Your wife's distress has been grievous

550
00:33:57,119 --> 00:34:00,659
and it is our duty to set her mind at rest.

551
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:06,299
You owe us, therefore, a full and frank account of your strange deception.

552
00:34:07,659 --> 00:34:11,000
Sindham, Claire buried his face in his hands for a moment,

553
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:14,199
then raised it with an expression of mingled shame and resignation.

554
00:34:15,019 --> 00:34:16,019
You shall know all.

555
00:34:16,319 --> 00:34:20,579
There is nothing criminal in my conduct, save the deceit of a double life.

556
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:26,079
When first I came to London, I found myself with modest means and no certain prospect.

557
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,639
effect. One day, in a spirit of idle curiosity, I disguised myself as a beggar, and took a

558
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:38,279
seat upon the steps of the exchange. To my amazement, I received more alms in a single

559
00:34:38,279 --> 00:34:43,960
day than I could have earned in a week by honest labour. The temptation proved too strong.

560
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:49,319
I perfected my disguise, altered my lip with a twist of wax and pigment, and soon found

561
00:34:49,319 --> 00:34:54,500
that I could command an income such as many a merchant might envy. By day, I lived as

562
00:34:54,500 --> 00:35:01,539
Neville St. Clair, a gentleman of respectability. By evening I became Boone, the crippled mendicant,

563
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:06,659
haunting the thoroughfares and filling my purse with the careless charity of passers-by.

564
00:35:07,539 --> 00:35:09,940
But sir, surely you've had shame at such a deception?

565
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:16,500
At first, doctor, I did indeed. Yet the gold was heavy in my pocket, and as the years passed,

566
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:22,820
I grew accustomed to the part. I told myself that I wronged no man, that I but accepted

567
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:30,019
what they freely gave. And in truth, I prospered. I built my house in Kentish Town. I married.

568
00:35:30,019 --> 00:35:36,100
I became a father. None suspected, save the wretched Lusca who let me the room above his den,

569
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:40,100
where I might transform myself unseen. And last night?

570
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:48,180
Ah, last night was my undoing. I had donned my disguise as usual and was in the act of changing

571
00:35:48,179 --> 00:36:04,739
in the room above the bar of gold when suddenly i heard my wife's voice in the street below she had seen me at the window ere i could withdraw in my panic i dragged myself back closed the sash and flung off my gentleman's clothes at that instant the constable burst in

572
00:36:04,739 --> 00:36:16,659
i had but a moment to thrust the garments aside and resume the semblance of boon they found me thus and i held stubbornly to the part i never dreamed that holmes would pierce the veil so swiftly

573
00:36:16,659 --> 00:36:19,839
and the blood upon the toy block.

574
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:21,159
A trifle.

575
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:23,920
I had cut my finger as I strove in haste

576
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,319
to conceal my appearance.

577
00:36:25,779 --> 00:36:27,119
The toy was in my pocket

578
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,839
and so it was stained.

579
00:36:29,219 --> 00:36:31,420
I swear, there was no violence, no crime,

580
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:32,619
save my own duplicity.

581
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:35,819
Inspector Bradstreet shook his head in astonishment.

582
00:36:36,679 --> 00:36:37,839
Well, I'll be bound.

583
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:40,059
In all my days, I've never seen the like.

584
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:42,299
You think that a respectable gentleman

585
00:36:42,299 --> 00:36:43,759
should masquerade thus?

586
00:36:44,139 --> 00:36:45,879
But as no crime has been committed,

587
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,960
Sabre fraud upon the public, I cannot hold you further.

588
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,240
You are free, sir.

589
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:54,519
Though I dare say you'll find your reputation in peril should this tale become known.

590
00:36:55,700 --> 00:37:01,360
Inspector, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I implore you, keep this secret from the world.

591
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,480
My wife and children, let them not suffer for my folly.

592
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:08,960
I give you my word, I shall never again don this loathsome garb.

593
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:12,800
The Holmes regarded him sternly for a moment, then softened.

594
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,400
Your punishment, sir, lies in the shame you feel and in the confidence you have betrayed.

595
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:22,800
I shall not add to it by public exposure.

596
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:28,560
The truth shall remain among ourselves, provided you keep your oaths.

597
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:34,620
Go then, and live henceforth as Neville St. Clair, the honest gentleman.

598
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:41,440
But remember, the eye of conscience is sharper than mine, and it will follow you wheresoever you go.

599
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:46,860
St. Clair bowed his head in silent gratitude, and the matter was thus concluded.

600
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:51,320
Yet as we quitted the police station and stepped once more into the foggy street,

601
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,840
I could not refrain from expressing my wonder.

602
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:57,760
Holmes, this is the strangest case we have yet encountered.

603
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:02,820
Who could have believed that a man would lead so double a life and for so base a reason?

604
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,860
It is but another proof, Watson, that truth is ever stranger than fiction.

605
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:15,500
The world is full of masks and deceptions, and it is the task of the detective to tear them away.

606
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:27,360
In this instance, the mask was literal, and the truth lay beneath a smear of pigment and a twist of wax, elementary, once the cue was grasped.

607
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:35,860
But to Mrs. Saint, clear. The truth will be joy, and that, I think, is satisfaction enough.

608
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:39,059
We rode back to Baker Street in thoughtful silence,

609
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,640
while the city slumbered beneath its pall of mist,

610
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:44,780
and thus ended the case of The Man with the Twisted Lip,

611
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:47,440
a case which, for sheer singularity of circumstance,

612
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,559
stands unmatched in my long association with Sherlock Holmes.

613
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,280
The fog had lifted somewhat by the time we returned to Baker Street,

614
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:58,200
though the air was still damp with the lingering breath of the Thames.

615
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,260
Holmes, silent and contemplative, hung his coat upon the peg,

616
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:04,220
lit the lamp, and flung himself into a familiar chair by the fire,

617
00:39:04,219 --> 00:39:07,559
followed, sinking wearily into my accustomed seat.

618
00:39:07,739 --> 00:39:09,139
The events of the last hours,

619
00:39:09,419 --> 00:39:10,939
the confrontation, the revelation,

620
00:39:11,139 --> 00:39:12,179
the strange confession,

621
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:14,359
still weighed heavily upon my mind.

622
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,519
Holmes, I can scarcely believe it even now

623
00:39:17,519 --> 00:39:19,839
to think that a man could live such a double life

624
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,739
and that beneath the tatters of a beggar

625
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:23,919
there should lurk a respectable gentleman.

626
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:25,759
It is as though one of Dickens' tears

627
00:39:25,759 --> 00:39:27,799
had sprung to life before our very eyes.

628
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,839
You are right, Watson.

629
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,879
It is a tale for the penny magazines.

630
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:37,099
Yet it illustrates a principle I have long held

631
00:39:37,099 --> 00:39:40,039
that appearances are but the surface of things

632
00:39:40,039 --> 00:39:44,059
and that beneath the mask of poverty may lie the craft of wealth

633
00:39:44,059 --> 00:39:48,280
even as beneath the guise of wealth may lurk the gunning of crime.

634
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,140
In short, we must reason from facts, not from preconceptions.

635
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,420
He leaned back, the smoke from his pipe,

636
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,420
reading about his aesthetic features.

637
00:40:00,420 --> 00:40:05,500
You see, the case was not truly so impenetrable as it appeared.

638
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,079
There was no murder, no abduction, no supernatural disappearance,

639
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:14,740
merely a clever disguise, sustained by long practice.

640
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,659
The clean hands betrayed him, the sovereigns gave him away,

641
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:24,139
and the speed with which he transformed himself in that chamber was the final proof.

642
00:40:24,139 --> 00:40:30,759
All was elementally once one permitted oneself to think of the possibility

643
00:40:30,759 --> 00:40:35,279
And yet, Holmes, do you not feel some measure of pity for the man?

644
00:40:35,539 --> 00:40:38,699
His shame, his secrecy, the terror of exposure

645
00:40:38,699 --> 00:40:41,359
Must it not have weighed upon him heavily through the years?

646
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:45,500
No doubt, Watson, but pity is not my trade

647
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:47,819
I concern myself with truth

648
00:40:47,819 --> 00:40:52,059
And it is for the man himself to reckon with conscience

649
00:40:52,059 --> 00:41:00,719
Still, I am not inhuman. I agreed to keep his secret, for the sake of his innocent wife and children.

650
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,679
Their happiness outweighs the satisfaction of public justice in this instance.

651
00:41:07,159 --> 00:41:14,199
Let the man bury Boone with his own hands, and may Neville's saint, Clare, henceforth, walk an honest road.

652
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:18,799
For a time we sat in silence, the fire crackling softly in the grate.

653
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:36,640
i thought of mrs st claire waiting even now in her little villa at kentish town her heart torn between dread and hope at length i could bear it no longer holmes surely we should carry her the tidings at once it is cruer to let her pass another hour in uncertainty

654
00:41:36,639 --> 00:41:51,539
spoken like a true dr watson ever with an eye to the patient's suffering very well we shall go together a cab will take us swiftly and perhaps you may play the herald of glad news

655
00:41:51,539 --> 00:41:55,420
And so, despite the lateness of the hour, we set forth once more.

656
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,179
The streets were quieter now, the lands burning low, but the city never sleeps entirely.

657
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:02,800
Soon we stood once more before the modest villa.

658
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,900
Holmes bade me be the one to knock.

659
00:42:05,099 --> 00:42:09,300
And when Mrs. Bezala, mm, Saint Mum, Claire herself answered,

660
00:42:09,619 --> 00:42:14,159
candle in hand, her face pale with long vigils, I took her trembling hand in mine.

661
00:42:15,019 --> 00:42:16,519
Madam, be comforted.

662
00:42:16,759 --> 00:42:19,279
Your husband lives and is safe, tinklers his self.

663
00:42:19,279 --> 00:42:21,400
His absence was not the work of violence.

664
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:23,539
but of his own most singular deception.

665
00:42:23,779 --> 00:42:25,480
He will return to you this very night,

666
00:42:25,719 --> 00:42:28,059
penitent, and resolved to cast off forever

667
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:30,079
the mask which has so tormented you.

668
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:30,719
Best!

669
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,019
All is well.

670
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,519
At these words, she uttered a cry of joy,

671
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,719
and the candle merely fell from her grasp.

672
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,619
Tears streamed down her cheeks

673
00:42:39,619 --> 00:42:41,400
as she pressed my hand to her lips.

674
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,000
Oh doctor, you bring me back to life.

675
00:42:44,259 --> 00:42:45,039
Tell me no more.

676
00:42:45,279 --> 00:42:46,579
I ask no questions.

677
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:49,000
If Neville lives and will return,

678
00:42:49,219 --> 00:42:50,480
that is all I need.

679
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,760
God bless you and God bless Mr. Holmes.

680
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:54,780
Wand

681
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:57,860
We left her thus.

682
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,019
Her heart lightened.

683
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,159
Her candle held high as do it were the lamp of hope itself.

684
00:43:03,579 --> 00:43:05,360
Holmes said nothing as we re-entered the cab

685
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,119
but his eyes softened and I thought I perceived in him a rare glow of satisfaction.

686
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:13,199
Back at Baker Street, as dawn broke pale and worn across the housetops

687
00:43:13,199 --> 00:43:16,679
Holmes stretched himself upon the sofa and closed his eyes.

688
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:19,019
Another case concluded.

689
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:19,639
Watson

690
00:43:19,639 --> 00:43:26,440
Strange, grotesque, perhaps even sordid, but instructive.

691
00:43:27,219 --> 00:43:30,799
Let it stand in your notes as an example of the power of disguise

692
00:43:30,799 --> 00:43:35,299
and of the folly of assuming that poverty must always be genuine.

693
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,679
There is no such school of imposture as London itself.

694
00:43:40,339 --> 00:43:42,199
It breeds deceits in every alley,

695
00:43:42,539 --> 00:43:47,539
and it is our task to tear away the mask, whether it hides crime or folly.

696
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:50,659
I shall set it down faithfully, Holmes

697
00:43:50,659 --> 00:43:53,659
And though some may find it less sensational than murder or conspiracy

698
00:43:53,659 --> 00:43:56,619
I venture to think that readers will find it no less remarkable

699
00:43:56,619 --> 00:43:58,699
Smiling faintly

700
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:01,559
Then my work has not been in vain

701
00:44:01,559 --> 00:44:04,179
For if the tale instructs one mind

702
00:44:04,179 --> 00:44:06,320
Sharpens one perception

703
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:09,000
Or lifts one veil of ignorance

704
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,860
It has served its purpose

705
00:44:10,860 --> 00:44:13,279
And now, Watson, to bed

706
00:44:13,279 --> 00:44:16,920
The next telegram may summon us to some fresh absurdity

707
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:18,500
and we must be ready.

708
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:51,760
logic. Beneath his keen deductions lay a thread of mercy, a willingness to temper justice

709
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:57,320
with compassion when the innocent might suffer by too rigid an application of law. That,

710
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:02,360
perhaps, was the truest revelation of all. And so I close this record as the lamps of

711
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:07,599
Baker Street fade into memory and the figure of my friend stands once more before me. Lean,

712
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:12,860
ascetic, pipe in hand, his eyes alight with that flame of intellect which burned so steadily

713
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:16,200
and which cast its glow upon many a darkened corner of the human soul,
