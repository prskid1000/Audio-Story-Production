00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,830
It has always been my custom, in these quiet years of practice and retirement,

00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,379
to set down some of the more remarkable adventures

00:00:06,379 --> 00:00:10,570
in which I had the privilege to take part with my friend Sherlock Holmes.

00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:14,080
Among them, there is none which I recall with a sharper thrill of memory

00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,039
than that singular case which Holmes himself was later to describe as the Speckled Band.

00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,080
..

00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,019
Though many years have passed since those strange events occurred,

00:00:23,019 --> 00:00:25,879
the impression of terror upon the young lady who sought our aid

00:00:25,879 --> 00:00:29,719
and the grim figure of her violent stepfather remained etched upon my recollection

00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,670
as though the affair had only transpired yesterday.

00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:34,939
The reader will remember that in those days,

00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,799
I had resumed medical practice

00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,299
and I was not residing permanently at Baker Street.

00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,179
Yet my companionship with Holmes remained undiminished

00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:45,179
and I was frequently summoned either by letter or telegram

00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:48,859
whenever he believed that my presence might contribute in any way to his work

00:00:48,859 --> 00:00:51,299
or at the very least to his spirits.

00:00:51,299 --> 00:00:54,189
It was then, in the early days of April,

00:00:54,189 --> 00:00:56,159
upon a morning to yoke and drizzle and mist

00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:59,659
that I found myself once more beneath the familiar roof of our lodgings

00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:02,140
at 221B Baker Street.

00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:04,120
Holmes had risen earlier than usual,

00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,900
for I discovered him pacing the room,

00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,109
his lean figure bent,

00:01:07,109 --> 00:01:09,500
his eyes gleaming with the restless energy

00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:12,870
that ever betokened the approach of a new investigation.

00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,819
He had already flung himself into his chair by the fire

00:01:15,819 --> 00:01:17,409
when the bell downstairs rang,

00:01:17,409 --> 00:01:18,400
and a moment later,

00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,449
Mrs. Zecker! Mrs. Zecker!

00:01:20,449 --> 00:01:22,640
Hudson ushered in a young lady.

00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,020
Her appearance haggard,

00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,469
her step quick and uncertain,

00:01:25,469 --> 00:01:27,099
as though she had travelled far

00:01:27,099 --> 00:01:29,019
and borne a heavy burden upon her spirit.

00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:33,479
Good heavens, Holmes, I exclaimed softly, rising to my feet.

00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:36,859
The poor woman looks as though she has not slept for nights.

00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:42,810
Indeed, Watson, said Holmes, his eyes narrowing with that hawk-like expression.

00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,189
I knew so well.

00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:51,819
And notice the trembling of her hands, the hurried breathing, and the bruise upon her wrist.

00:01:51,819 --> 00:01:54,429
This is no ordinary visitor.

00:01:54,429 --> 00:01:57,000
Allow her a seat near the fire.

00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,819
The lady, clad in black and heavily veiled, sank into the armchair which Holmes indicated.

00:02:02,819 --> 00:02:05,009
For a moment she struggled to speak.

00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,480
Then her composure broke and she pressed her hand to her throat.

00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:12,529
Mr. Holmes, she said at last, her voice low yet urgent,

00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:15,000
I can bear this suspense no longer.

00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,699
..

00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,919
If ever you have shown compassion for a helpless woman,

00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,680
you will listen to me now.

00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,969
For I am in mortal peril and unless you advise me what to do,

00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:29,219
I may not live to see another day.

00:02:29,219 --> 00:02:32,040
I lean forward, deeply concerned.

00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,819
You may speak freely, madam.

00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:36,550
You are among friends who will help you.

00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:39,259
Ah, Oum's inclined his head and,

00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,939
Pray, compose yourself and tell us, in your own words,

00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:47,819
exactly what brings you here at this early hour.

00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:50,139
Every detail is important.

00:02:50,139 --> 00:02:52,580
The young lady pushed back her veil,

00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:55,080
revealing a pained face, tinned from anxiety,

00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,170
yet still bearing traces of beauty.

00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,760
Her dark eyes were hollow

00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,660
and in them shone the unmistakable light of fear.

00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,760
..

00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,390
My name is Helen Stoner.

00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:07,590
I reside with my stepfather,

00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:12,639
Dr. Grimsby Roylott of Stoke Moran in Surrey.

00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:13,180
Oh!

00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,480
......

00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,370
My twin sister, Julia,

00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,900
died under the strangest circumstances

00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:24,020
nearly two years ago

00:03:24,020 --> 00:03:28,150
and now I myself am threatened with the same fate.

00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:31,350
That is why I have come to you, Mr. Holmes.

00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:36,610
For last night I was forced to sleep in the very chamber where she perished.

00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:40,480
Holmes sat upright, his long fingers steepled beneath his chin.

00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,280
Now days, and his keen grey eyes fixed upon her face

00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,330
with an intensity that seemed to draw forth the truth from her lips.

00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:51,920
Your story is of the utmost gravity, Miss Stoner.

00:03:51,919 --> 00:03:54,560
We shall examine it carefully.

00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,680
But first, permit me to make some observations which may appear trivial.

00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:06,060
You came here by train this morning, I think, and then by dog-cart from the station?

00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:06,539
Oh!

00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:07,639
..

00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,479
Her eyes widened in astonishment.

00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:12,769
That is exactly so, sir.

00:04:12,769 --> 00:04:15,189
But how could you possibly know?

00:04:15,189 --> 00:04:17,409
Holmes smiled faintly.

00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:18,879
It is elementary.

00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:36,759
your left sleeve bears the fresh mark of a ticket punch and the gravel upon your boots is peculiar to the lane from leatherhead station as for the dog-cart the splashes upon your skirt are too high for mere walking these trifles are sufficient

00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,740
I shook my head with admiration.

00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:41,819
Holmes, your methods never cease to amaze me.

00:04:41,819 --> 00:04:45,490
Miss Stoner regarded Holmes with a look that mingled relief with awe,

00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:47,719
as though she already placed her life in his hands.

00:04:47,719 --> 00:04:49,099
..

00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:53,439
Then you will understand, sir, that I come to you in desperation.

00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:59,519
My sister Julia, God rest her soul, was but thirty years of age when she died.

00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:01,300
..

00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:05,279
The circumstances of her death have haunted me ever since.

00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:11,929
And now, with my own marriage approaching, I have reason to believe that I too am marked for destruction.

00:05:11,929 --> 00:05:16,569
Your marriage, you say? Then the timing of this danger is surely no accident.

00:05:16,569 --> 00:05:22,559
Indeed, Watson, Holmes replied gravely. But let us not anticipate.

00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:31,559
Miss Stoner, begin at the beginning. Tell us about your family, your home, and this Dr. Shaw, Roylott, of whom you spoke.

00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,950
She clasped her hands tightly in her lap, gathering her courage,

00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:40,460
and then began to recount her tale, which I listened to with mounting uneasiness.

00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:47,800
My stepfather is the last surviving descendant of the once wealthy royal hordes of Stoke Moran.

00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,259
The family was long notorious for their violence and hot temper.

00:05:53,259 --> 00:05:57,789
The estate has dwindled and my stepfather, after practising medicine in India,

00:05:57,789 --> 00:05:59,620
returned to England many years ago.

00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:07,149
He married my mother, a widow with some fortune, when my sister Julia and I were mere children.

00:06:07,149 --> 00:06:13,379
But alas, my mother was killed in a railway accident eight years ago, leaving us in his sole care.

00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,800
....

00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,629
Holmes's brows knit as she continued and he noted down particulars in his pocketbook with quick strokes of his pencil.

00:06:23,629 --> 00:06:29,470
My stepfather has lived ever since in gloomy seclusion at Stoke Moran.

00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,840
He has few friends, if any, and his temper is terrible.

00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,500
He has been known to beat the native servants

00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,269
and more than once has been in trouble with the law for violent assaults.

00:06:41,269 --> 00:06:44,060
He allows gypsies to camp upon our grounds

00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:47,560
and keeps strange creatures, cheetahs and baboons,

00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:49,970
that wander freely about the estate.

00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,600
A most unusual household, I murmured, and dangerous by the sound of it.

00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,529
Proceed, Miss Stoner.

00:06:56,529 --> 00:06:59,550
Holmes urged his voice calm but intent.

00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,459
Tell us of your sister's death.

00:07:01,459 --> 00:07:02,560
..

00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,080
It was an early spring, nearly two years ago.

00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,680
My sister Julia announced her engagement,

00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,300
and arrangements were being made for her marriage.

00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,079
Then, one night, she was seized with sudden terror.

00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:16,000
I shall never forget it.

00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,960
She came to my chamber, her face white with dread,

00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,420
and told me she had heard a low whistle in the dead of night,

00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,960
and afterwards a metallic clang.

00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,980
I tried to reassure her,

00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:31,100
but she was trembling so that I feared for her reason.

00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:35,660
.....

00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:39,970
Miss Stoner paused, her breath quickening as she recalled the dreadful events.

00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:42,740
Holmes leaned forward, every muscle alert.

00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:46,680
On that fatal night, she retired to her room as usual.

00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,639
About midnight, I heard a piercing scream and I rushed out.

00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,360
There was the sound of her door unlocking and she staggered into the corridor.

00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,110
Her features were convulsed with pain.

00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:04,230
She fell to the ground, writhing, and in a choking voice she gasped out the words,

00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,750
The speckle band!

00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:09,779
Then she sank into unconsciousness and died within moments.

00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:13,120
But yeah, I could not restrain my exclamation.

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,389
What a terrible tragedy! And those were her final words?

00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:22,429
Yes, the doctors could find no poison in her system and the coroner's verdict was inconclusive.

00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:25,759
But I have lived ever since in fear of that mystery.

00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,889
Giliosi? My meek.

00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:35,059
And last night, said Holmes, you yourself were compelled to occupy the same room?

00:08:35,059 --> 00:08:36,500
..

00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,360
Yes, Mr. Holmes, repair the being carried out on the wing where I usually sleep.

00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,449
My stepfather insisted that I move temporarily into Julia's old chamber.

00:08:46,449 --> 00:08:53,939
Imagine my terror when, as I lay awake, I heard again that same low whistle that she described.

00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:58,680
I could bear it no longer and I fled here to you at dawn.

00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,860
..

00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:03,550
As she concluded her narrative, her whole frame trembled with agitation.

00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:06,490
Holmes rose and paced the room, his brow furrowed in thought.

00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:10,640
For some minutes he did not speak and only the crackling of the fire disturbed the silence.

00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,780
Then he turned abruptly to her.

00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:16,360
Miss Stoner, you have done wisely to come to me.

00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:25,350
There are features in your story which make it one of the most extraordinary cases I have ever encountered.

00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,169
Rest assured I shall undertake your defense with all the energy at my command.

00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:36,080
Watson and I shall visit Stoke Moran today to investigate matters for ourselves.

00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
..

00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,120
You may rely on us, Miss Stoner, I said earnestly.

00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,730
We shall do all in our power to protect you.

00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,320
God bless you both.

00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,360
..

00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:49,620
She whispered, tears descending in her eyes.

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:53,279
For I feel that my very life hangs by a thread.

00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,830
Thus ended her account, leaving us both profoundly stirred.

00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,049
Little did I suspect that before the day was done,

00:09:59,049 --> 00:10:03,080
we should stand face to face with a mystery darker than any we had yet encountered.

00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,630
When Miss Helen Stoner had finished her account,

00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:07,720
silence reigned in our sitting room for a time.

00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,099
Holmes stood by the window,

00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:11,940
his thin form silhouetted against the grey morning light,

00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:15,060
the smoke of his pipe wreathing about his head like a veil.

00:10:15,059 --> 00:10:18,220
His gaze was fixed upon the drifting fog in Baker Street.

00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:24,730
Yet I knew that within his mind the machinery of reason was already turning with astonishing rapidity.

00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,899
Holmes, I ventured at last.

00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:30,439
This is surely one of the most singular cases we have yet encountered.

00:10:30,439 --> 00:10:35,159
The death of Miss Stoner's sister, the mysterious whistle, the strange last words.

00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:37,659
What possible explanation can there be?

00:10:37,659 --> 00:10:40,779
He turned shockingly, his eyes alight.

00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:44,219
There, Watson, lies the fascination of the affair.

00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:50,269
It is precisely because the explanation is not obvious that it appeals to me.

00:10:50,269 --> 00:10:57,740
A whistle in the dead of night, a metallic clang, a dying reference to a speckled band.

00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:04,750
Each piece may seem inexplicable alone, but together they must form a chain.

00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:08,850
And chains, as you know, may be traced link by link.

00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:12,950
Miss Stoner, who had been sitting with her hands clasped tightly in her lap,

00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:16,069
looked from one to the other of us with desperate anxiety.

00:11:16,069 --> 00:11:19,320
You give me hope, Mr. Holmes, for until this moment,

00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:25,049
I have lived under a shadow so dark that I believed myself lost.

00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:28,019
Tell me, do you think I am in immediate danger?

00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,060
..

00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:36,620
Your stepfather, Dr. Roylott, has insisted that you occupy your sister's old chamber.

00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:40,960
That fact alone suggests a sinister purpose.

00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:45,430
Yes, Miss Stoner, you are in peril, but be reassured.

00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,450
We shall act swiftly.

00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,210
You will return home now.

00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:55,069
Continue your ordinary habits and, above all, show no suspicion that you have sought advice.

00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:59,139
Tonight, Dr. Watson and I shall come to Stoke Moran.

00:11:59,139 --> 00:12:01,559
I could not conceal my eagerness.

00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:05,120
Owns you mean that we shall examine the very room in which Julia Stoner died?

00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,320
precisely Watson

00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,440
there lies the key to the riddle

00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,360
until I have seen it with my own eyes

00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,799
I shall not hazard a theory

00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:17,039
the swooner rose

00:12:17,039 --> 00:12:18,159
visibly relieved

00:12:18,159 --> 00:12:19,759
that her burden was now shared

00:12:19,759 --> 00:12:21,700
yet her fear had not wholly left her

00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,179
and she clutched Holmes's hand

00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:25,000
with a grip that betrayed her agitation

00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,100
I shall obey you implicitly Mr. Holmes

00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,000
and tonight then you will come

00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,659
without fail

00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:34,200
Watson and I shall follow at dusk

00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:50,800
until then have courage she drew her veil once more over her pale features and departed leaving the room charged with a tense expectancy concomity or shambland holmes your manner is grave do you truly think her life in such imminent danger

00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:56,879
He seated himself once more, his long fingers tapping thoughtfully upon the arm of his chair.

00:12:56,879 --> 00:13:02,889
Consider, Watson, a young woman dies suddenly on the eve of marriage,

00:13:02,889 --> 00:13:06,399
leaving only the cryptic words, the speckled band.

00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:10,259
....

00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:16,839
Two years later, her twin sister, similarly betrothed, is compelled to occupy the same chamber

00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:19,579
and already hears the same warning signal.

00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:22,740
The parallel is too exact to be coincidence

00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:29,180
Yes, I fear we are dealing with a cunning and dangerous adversary

00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:32,620
At that instant, the bell rang violently below

00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:36,160
And footsteps were heard ascending the stair with a heavy tread

00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,379
Mrs. Hudson's timid knock preceded the entrance of a tall, massive man

00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:44,320
Who burst into our sitting room with an energy that shook the door upon its hinges

00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,400
He was a formidable figure, his face large and swarthy

00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,860
his eyes yellow and cruel, his clothing coarse, though of rich material, a hunting crop protruded

00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:01,200
from his hand, and his whole appearance bespoke strength and ferocity. Holmes regarded him coolly.

00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:09,240
Pray be seated, Dr. Grimesby Roylott. The intruder did not sit, but glared at us with a savage

00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:15,840
intensity. To you are Sherlock Holmes, he growled, his voice harsh and guttural, and you, I take it,

00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:20,580
our Dr. Cotterill. Watson, my step-daughter had been here. What has she been saying to you?

00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:26,660
That, replied Holmes evenly, is a matter between myself and my client.

00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,720
..

00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,390
He advanced the step, shaking his heavy stick. I am a dangerous man to cross, Mr. Holmes.

00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:34,529
I have not hesitated to use violence before, and I shall not hesitate again.

00:14:34,529 --> 00:14:40,890
Nay! My family is an old one, and my will is law upon my estate. Do not meddle with my affairs,

00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:44,800
or you may find it an ill day for you. I rose in indignation.

00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:50,409
Sir, this is monstrous. Lam Su, you have no right to threaten us in our own chambers.

00:14:50,409 --> 00:14:53,599
Holmes, however, remained perfectly composed.

00:14:53,599 --> 00:14:58,579
His pale smile, so calm and sardonic, seemed to enrage our visitor still further.

00:14:58,579 --> 00:15:03,539
Your temper, Dr. Roylott, is well known to the magistrates of Surrey.

00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:08,730
Yes, you have served time for assault, if I am not mistaken.

00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:12,139
Do not imagine that intimidation will turn me from my duty.

00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:17,220
I have but one concern, the welfare of your stepdaughter.

00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,100
..

00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,009
The doctor's huge hands clenched until the veins stood out upon his skin.

00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:27,599
He bent forward until his face was but inches from Holmes's.

00:15:27,599 --> 00:15:31,349
Take care, Mr. Holmes. You are meddling with powers you do not comprehend.

00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:36,190
With that, he swung his hunting crop through the air and, to our astonishment,

00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,409
brought it crashing down upon the fireplace poker.

00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:41,039
The metal rod bent almost double beneath the blow.

00:15:41,039 --> 00:15:48,200
With a triumphant snarl, he strode from the room, slamming the door behind him with such violence that the windows rattle in their frames.

00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,200
I hurried to the poker and stared at the twisted iron.

00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:56,500
Holmes, the man has the strength of a giant. You cannot hope to oppose such brute force.

00:15:56,500 --> 00:16:04,539
Holmes smiled faintly and, without apparent effort, bent the poker back into its original shape.

00:16:04,539 --> 00:16:07,919
Watson, violence is no substitute for intellect.

00:16:07,919 --> 00:16:12,429
We shall oppose him, not with strength, but with reason.

00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:17,559
And reason, my dear friend, will always triumph.

00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,129
His quiet confidence reassured me.

00:16:20,129 --> 00:16:25,730
Jack, sir, yet I could not suppress a shudder at the thought of the villainous figure we had just encountered.

00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:32,009
It is fortunate for us that Roylott has shown his hand so plainly, Holmes continued.

00:16:32,009 --> 00:16:36,379
His very violence betrays his guilty conscience.

00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:44,289
He knows that Miss Stoner has spoken to me, and he fears exposure, all the more reason for us to act at once.

00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:45,519
Then we go today?

00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,860
..

00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,840
Yes, Watson.

00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,919
..

00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:55,750
This afternoon we shall take the train to Leatherhead, and from there Hyra convains to Stoke Moran.

00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,639
There we shall examine the room where Julia Stoner met her death.

00:16:59,639 --> 00:17:05,940
That room will tell us more than all the threats of Grimesby Roylott.

00:17:05,940 --> 00:17:09,110
With that, Horns fell into one of his characteristic silences,

00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:12,650
his eyes half closed, half his spite between his lips,

00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:14,890
as though he were detached from the world around him.

00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,559
Yet, I knew that beneath that quiet exterior,

00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:20,370
his brain was wheeling together the fragments of evidence,

00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,250
forging from them a pattern which I,

00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,840
with all my medical training and practical common sense,

00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:26,370
could not yet perceive.

00:17:26,370 --> 00:17:28,460
Thus it was that, later that day,

00:17:28,460 --> 00:17:30,500
we set forth, together on the path

00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,060
that would lead us to Stoke Moran

00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,840
and to the revelation of one of the strangest

00:17:34,839 --> 00:17:38,529
and most dreadful secrets it has ever been my lot to witness.

00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:41,740
The afternoon found Holmes and myself seated side by side

00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,099
in a railway carriage bound for Ladakhia.

00:17:44,099 --> 00:17:49,519
The day was grey, with a damp mist hanging yo over the fields of Surrey.

00:17:49,519 --> 00:17:53,519
Holmes, wrapped in his long Inverness cloak, leaned back with closed eyes.

00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,449
The very picture of repose.

00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,319
And yet from the quick tapping of his fingers upon his knee,

00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:02,579
I perceived that his mind was in restless motion.

00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,439
Holmes, I said at last.

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,460
You have formed some theory already, I am sure of it.

00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:11,550
The story of Miss Stoner, the violence of her stepfather, surely it points to something?

00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:16,210
His eyes opened and he gave me a quick smile.

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:21,090
A theory, Watson, yes, but one that still lacks foundation.

00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:27,009
To theorize before one has all the evidence is a capital mistake.

00:18:27,009 --> 00:18:31,159
I have suspicions, certainly, but suspicion is not proof.

00:18:31,159 --> 00:18:34,309
Proof must be gathered at Stoke Moran.

00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:37,480
Until then, I withhold judgment.

00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,329
And yet, I persisted, you speak of Miss Stoner being in grave peril.

00:18:41,329 --> 00:18:44,400
You must have some notion of what form that peril takes.

00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,369
He leaned forward, his expression suddenly serious.

00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:50,320
Think, Watson.

00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,170
The late Julia Stoner spoke of a speckled band.

00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:57,500
The words are vague, but they suggest something visible.

00:18:57,500 --> 00:18:58,759
..

00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:02,259
Add to this the nightly whistle, the metallic clang,

00:19:02,259 --> 00:19:05,820
and the fact that no poison was detected in her body,

00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:10,619
clearly we are dealing with a subtle and unusual method of murder.

00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:14,309
Only by examining her room shall we know the truth.

00:19:14,309 --> 00:19:14,859
Hark!

00:19:14,859 --> 00:19:16,500
..

00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,159
He said no more, and we journeyed the remainder of the way in silence.

00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,789
Presently we arrived at the licking station of Leatherhead,

00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:27,699
where we engaged a dog cart and drove through winding lanes bordered by budding hedgerows.

00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,299
The country was quiet, yet there hung about it a sense of desolation,

00:19:31,299 --> 00:19:35,379
as though nature herself recoiled from the human habitation we were soon to visit.

00:19:35,379 --> 00:19:36,460
..

00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:39,279
At length we turned into a drive that led up to a gloomy house,

00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:42,719
half ruined, choking in places, its windows shuttered and broken.

00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,400
Here and there repairs had been attempted, but the effect was,

00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,400
but to emphasize the general decay,

00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:51,869
tall trees overhung the building, casting dark shadows even in the wan daylight,

00:19:51,869 --> 00:19:54,239
and the air seemed heavy with melancholy.

00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,119
Cheerless place homes, I murmured, gazing up at the ancient stone.

00:19:58,119 --> 00:20:03,719
Indeed, Watson, Stoke Moran is well suited to the character of its master.

00:20:03,719 --> 00:20:08,159
Look there, see the clumps of gypsy tents upon the meadow.

00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:13,719
Roylott has permitted them to camp here, and they repay him with their lawless loyalty.

00:20:13,719 --> 00:20:14,779
..

00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:18,980
Even as he spoke, a pair of swarthy men in gaudy garments passed us.

00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:21,559
Their dark eyes following with open suspicion.

00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:26,079
From behind the house there came the cry of some strange beast, half snarling, half wailing.

00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:30,279
I started an alarm. What in heaven's name was that?

00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:34,339
Holmes shrugged. One of Dr. Roylott's pets?

00:20:34,339 --> 00:20:39,279
A cheetah, perhaps, or the baboon of which Miss Stoner spoke.

00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:45,909
He delights in surrounding himself with savage creatures, as if to mirror his own spirit.

00:20:45,909 --> 00:20:50,849
Good, we drew up before the entrance, and thereupon the steps awaited Miss Helen Stoner.

00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:53,939
Her pale face brightened with relief as she beheld us.

00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,539
Oh, thank God you have come, she exclaimed hastening forward.

00:20:59,539 --> 00:21:02,100
I have lived these hours in dread.

00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,860
..

00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:07,700
He has gone into town for the day, but will return before evening.

00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,389
We must be quick.

00:21:09,389 --> 00:21:12,400
Holmes raised his hand reassuringly.

00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:14,610
All shall be done in order, Miss Stoner.

00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,140
First, lead us to the rooms in question.

00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:20,180
I would see your chamber and your sisters.

00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:23,240
She guided us through a dark oak passage.

00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:25,900
Its panels were eaten with age.

00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,240
Until we came to a small suite of rooms,

00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,779
the first door opened upon her present bedroom,

00:21:30,779 --> 00:21:33,070
brightened by a single window, Dowager.

00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:35,929
Next was a narrow passage leading to the fatal chamber,

00:21:35,929 --> 00:21:39,949
and beyond that, the room used by Dr. Roylott himself.

00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:44,519
This arrangement is most suggestive, murmured Holmes.

00:21:44,519 --> 00:21:48,429
The father's room adjoining, the daughter's chamber in the middle.

00:21:48,429 --> 00:21:51,960
Trey, Miss Stoner, show us Julia's old room,

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,829
where you now sleep.

00:21:53,829 --> 00:21:55,139
Yashara's within,

00:21:55,139 --> 00:21:56,559
it was a small chamber,

00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:57,630
plainly furnished,

00:21:57,630 --> 00:21:58,559
with a low ceiling

00:21:58,559 --> 00:21:59,759
and a single window

00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:01,030
that overlooked the lawn.

00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:03,220
The wallpaper was old and faded

00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,059
and the air of the place was closed

00:22:05,059 --> 00:22:07,050
as though it had long been shut.

00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,780
A modest room, I said,

00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:09,730
glancing about.

00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,559
Yet I feel a chill here, Holmes,

00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:12,740
as though it still holds

00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:14,299
the memory of tragedy.

00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,130
He made no reply,

00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:18,100
but his keen eyes darted

00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,769
from one object to another.

00:22:19,769 --> 00:22:21,259
He examined the window,

00:22:21,259 --> 00:22:26,259
which was secured by strong shutters fastened from within.

00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:30,469
He tested the chimney, but it was narrow and impassable.

00:22:30,469 --> 00:22:33,320
Then he turned his attention to the bed,

00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,740
which stood clamped to the floor by iron screws.

00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:40,269
Why should a bed be fastened in this fashion?

00:22:40,269 --> 00:22:41,900
He asked softly.

00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,320
A most unusual arrangement.

00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,469
You cannot move it, even an inch.

00:22:47,469 --> 00:22:50,460
He next scrutinized the bell-rope, which hung close to the bed-head.

00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:53,610
It appeared to be a common pull cord for summoning servants.

00:22:53,610 --> 00:22:57,640
Holmes tugged at it, but to my surprise it was immovable.

00:22:57,640 --> 00:23:00,269
A dummy, he observed grimly.

00:23:00,269 --> 00:23:05,150
See, Watson, it is fastened to a brass hook above and leads nowhere.

00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,920
There is no wire behind it.

00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:12,930
Strange indeed, I murmured, but why should anyone place a sham bell rope by the bed?

00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:16,410
Holmes' lips tightened, but he said nothing.

00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:22,289
Instead, he mounted a chair and examined the small ventilator opening above the cord.

00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:25,400
Here, Watson, observe this vent.

00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,920
It does not lead to the outer air as one might expect,

00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:32,060
but communicates directly with the adjoining room.

00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,380
..

00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,849
Dock, dock, Roylott's chamber.

00:23:35,849 --> 00:23:40,100
Good heavens! Then sound might pass easily from one room to the other.

00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,240
..

00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:43,900
Precisely, and perhaps more than sound.

00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:50,019
I stared in amazement while Holmes descended slowly, his eyes gleaming with a suppressed excitement.

00:23:50,019 --> 00:23:53,800
He then requested that we examine Dr. Roller's own chamber.

00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:58,780
Miss Stoner led us into the adjoining room, which was larger and more comfortably furnished,

00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,090
with a great iron safe in the corner, a wooden chair and a small saucer of milk upon the top of the safe.

00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:07,809
Milk, I exclaimed, yet there is no cat.

00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:10,800
Holmes' voice was low and stern.

00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,200
No cat, Watson!

00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:17,490
But perhaps something more sinister that takes milk as food.

00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:22,980
And see here upon the safe, a small loop of cord, neatly coiled.

00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,849
He lifted it carefully. It was a dog lash.

00:24:25,849 --> 00:24:28,930
But instead of ending in a handle, it was tied into a loop.

00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:31,250
Holmes replaced it, his face grave.

00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:34,059
This matter grows darker with every moment.

00:24:34,059 --> 00:24:39,049
Miss Stoner, I must ask you to do exactly as I say.

00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:44,990
Tonight, when your stepfather returns, you must excuse yourself and retire early.

00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:50,630
When he's safely in his chamber, you will slip into another room, Dr. Tremoril.

00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:55,039
Watson and I shall occupy this one in secret.

00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,970
But whatever happens, breathe not a word of our presence.

00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,140
Do you understand?

00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:06,519
I do, Mr. Holmes, she whispered, her voice trembling, and I shall do precisely as you command.

00:25:06,519 --> 00:25:10,839
Only save me, for I cannot endure this terror any longer

00:25:10,839 --> 00:25:14,279
Courage, Miss Stoner, the end is at hand

00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:17,460
She pressed Holmes' hand with fervent gratitude

00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,920
And we withdrew to confer privacy in the garden

00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:23,519
Holmes' face, usually impassive, was alight with a fierce energy

00:25:23,519 --> 00:25:27,500
Watson, we stand upon the brink of discovery

00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,940
All the pieces are before us

00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,079
The dummy bell-rope, the ventilator, the bed clamped to the floor

00:25:34,079 --> 00:25:36,200
The milk, the loop of cord

00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,240
Tonight we shall know the truth

00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,019
But mark me well

00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:42,720
There is deadly peril in this business

00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:45,039
You may choose to remain behind

00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,960
I straightened with resolve

00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,480
Holmes, I go where you go

00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,139
Have I not always shared your dangers?

00:25:50,139 --> 00:25:52,220
Do not insult me by suggesting otherwise

00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,080
Darked

00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:56,740
He clasped my shoulder with rare warmth

00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,880
Spoken like the stone chest of friends

00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,039
Very well, Watson

00:26:02,039 --> 00:26:06,160
Tonight then we shall keep vigil in Julia Stoner's chamber

00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:11,920
and before dawn we shall have unraveled the riddle of the speckled band.

00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:16,560
With that solemn pledge, we departed the dismal house to await the coming night

00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:20,450
when the secret of Stoke Moran would at last be revealed.

00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:25,769
The sun had set in a haze of crimson, leaving the Surrey landscape dim and foreboding.

00:26:25,769 --> 00:26:29,000
Holmes and I lingered at Little Inn some miles from Stoke Moran,

00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,600
eating a meagre supper and conversing in low tones.

00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:35,259
The innkeeper, a ruddy-faced fellow, eyed us curiously,

00:26:35,259 --> 00:26:37,490
but Holmes gave no sign of his thoughts.

00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,219
Only once did he speak, his voice grave.

00:26:40,219 --> 00:26:45,190
Watson, tonight you must be calm, steady and silent.

00:26:45,190 --> 00:26:48,730
Whatever you see or hear, you must not stir,

00:26:48,730 --> 00:26:51,849
for our very lives may depend upon it.

00:26:51,849 --> 00:26:55,639
You alarm me, Holmes. Do you truly expect violence?

00:26:55,639 --> 00:26:58,779
Not violence in the form you imagine,

00:26:58,779 --> 00:27:02,819
but there is danger, subtle, swift and deadly.

00:27:02,819 --> 00:27:10,019
Keep your revolver close at hand, though I hope we shall not need it. Above all, watch!

00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:32,819
.......................

00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,449
of Stoke Moran, we found them unlatched.

00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,940
Passing silently within, we skirted the drive,

00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:39,869
keeping to the grass to muffle our steps.

00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:42,170
Holmes guided me with the certainty of a cat,

00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:44,069
his long arms wrapped in his cloak.

00:27:44,069 --> 00:27:46,059
Presently, we glimpsed a dim light

00:27:46,059 --> 00:27:48,099
burning in one of the upper windows,

00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,869
the doctor's room, no doubt.

00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:51,539
Trouching by the shrubbery,

00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,590
we waited until all was still.

00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:55,619
Then a slight figure stole out from the side door

00:27:55,619 --> 00:27:56,969
and glided toward us.

00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:58,130
It was Helen Stoner,

00:27:58,130 --> 00:28:00,239
her shawl wrapped tightly about her.

00:28:00,239 --> 00:28:02,710
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson,

00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:04,779
She whispered, he has returned.

00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:06,199
He is in his room.

00:28:06,199 --> 00:28:07,630
I have done as you said.

00:28:07,630 --> 00:28:09,779
I have retired early to the other wing.

00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,039
My stepfather suspects nothing.

00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,240
..

00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:13,919
Excellent.

00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,599
Now go at once and lock yourself in.

00:28:16,599 --> 00:28:19,700
Do not open your door until we summon you in the morning.

00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:22,190
No matter what occurs.

00:28:22,190 --> 00:28:24,700
She grasped Holmes' hand with trembling fingers.

00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:25,859
..

00:28:25,859 --> 00:28:27,039
God, God, you both.

00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,639
..

00:28:28,639 --> 00:28:31,579
With that she disappeared and Holmes beckoned me forward.

00:28:31,579 --> 00:28:36,299
We stole across the lawn, climbed lightly through the window of Julia Stoner's room,

00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,659
and closed the shutters behind us.

00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:42,639
Holmes, I whispered, my heart is beating as though it would burst.

00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,569
This place chills me to the bone.

00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:47,210
He pressed a finger to his lips.

00:28:47,210 --> 00:28:49,539
Hush, Watson, not a word.

00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,559
We are in the presence of our enemy.

00:28:51,559 --> 00:28:53,500
..

00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:57,779
The room lay in complete darkness, save for the faint glimmer of moonlight

00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:59,919
filtering through the cracks of the shutters.

00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:05,230
Holmes placed a small dark lantern upon the table, turning the shutter so that not a ray escaped.

00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,430
He then motioned me to sit upon the bed.

00:29:07,430 --> 00:29:12,039
While he took a chair beside me, his eyes fixed upon the ventilator above.

00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:17,550
For long hours we sat thus, scarcely daring to breathe, where the silence was oppressive,

00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:22,740
broken only by the occasional creak of the timbers or the far-off cry of some night creature.

00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:23,960
Thine dragged heavily.

00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,259
I could hear the beating of my own heart, the ticking of my watch,

00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:30,300
the faint hiss of Holmes' steady breathing.

00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,769
At length I leaned toward him and whispered,

00:29:32,769 --> 00:29:34,769
Holmes, how long must we wait?

00:29:34,769 --> 00:29:37,730
His answer came scarcely above a breath,

00:29:37,730 --> 00:29:42,500
until the signal comes, and it will come.

00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,660
..

00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,480
Midnight struck from a distant block.

00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,960
Still we sat in silence.

00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:49,240
My limbs grew stiff, my eyelids heavy,

00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:51,070
yet fear kept me from sleep.

00:29:51,070 --> 00:29:54,079
Suddenly Holmes stirred, raising his hand sharply.

00:29:54,079 --> 00:29:55,759
Listen, he hissed.

00:29:55,759 --> 00:29:59,659
From the next room, there sounded a soft, metallic scrape.

00:29:59,659 --> 00:30:03,559
Age could mean, as though some iron were being moved cautiously.

00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:07,199
Then came a silence so deep that I felt the hair upon my neck rise.

00:30:07,199 --> 00:30:07,769
Ow!

00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:11,190
After an interval, how long or short, I cannot say,

00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:14,969
there broke the stillness a sound so faint I could scarce believe my ears.

00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:19,030
It was a low whistle, rising and falling, strangely musical.

00:30:19,030 --> 00:30:23,039
Holmes sprang to his feet, his eyes gleaming in the darkness.

00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,680
The Siglo, steady Watson.

00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:53,039
............................

00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,309
its skin marked with livid speckles,

00:30:55,309 --> 00:30:59,190
its head raised and eyes gleaming like evil jewels in the sudden glare.

00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,039
Merciful heaven, I cried, recoiling.

00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,829
But Holmes had acted with the speed of lightning.

00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:07,579
Cheesing his cane, he lashed furiously at the creature,

00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:09,489
driving it back toward the ventilator.

00:31:09,489 --> 00:31:12,179
The snake hissed, its body writhing in fury,

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:14,379
and then it vanished through the opening.

00:31:14,379 --> 00:31:18,630
Back, quick, Watson, Holmes whispered hoarsely.

00:31:18,630 --> 00:31:20,119
It will strike elsewhere.

00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:26,969
Even as he spoke, there burst from the adjoining room a most unearthly scream, a cry so wild,

00:31:26,969 --> 00:31:32,179
so full of agony and terror, that it throws my very blood, because there followed a dreadful

00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,750
silence, broken only by a heavy thud as of a body falling to the ground.

00:31:36,750 --> 00:31:40,289
What has happened, Holmes? I gasped, springing up.

00:31:40,289 --> 00:31:48,259
He caught my arm. Wait, Watson, we dare not rush in unprepared. But I fear so the creature has

00:31:48,259 --> 00:31:55,240
turned upon its master. Diver! For some minutes we waited, scarcely daring to stir, until all

00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:01,519
was still once more. Then Holmes set his jaw and raised his lantern. Come, Watson, the matter is

00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:07,539
ended. We passed swiftly into the adjoining room. The sight that met our eyes would remain with me

00:32:07,539 --> 00:32:13,240
until the end of my days. There, sprawled across the bed, lay the figure of Dr. Ransmey Roylott,

00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,079
His limbs convulsed, his eyes glaring hideously, his face distorted in death.

00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:22,210
About his brow jumped the dreadful creature we had seen, the speckled snake.

00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:25,800
Its body wound tightly, its head raised in triumph.

00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:29,940
I recoiled in horror, the very devil incarnate.

00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:34,440
With calm precision, Holmes seized the dog lash from the safe,

00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,349
looped it swiftly about the reptile, and with a steady hand,

00:32:38,349 --> 00:32:41,819
drew the writhing creature back into the iron chamber.

00:32:41,819 --> 00:32:46,429
He flung it within, shut the door and turned the key.

00:32:46,429 --> 00:32:48,670
The matter is closed, Watson.

00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:54,130
Roylott is dead struck down by the very means he devised for another.

00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,029
I stood shaken, scarcely able to speak.

00:32:57,029 --> 00:32:59,989
The lantern light flickered upon the lifeless form of the doctor,

00:32:59,989 --> 00:33:02,949
upon the ghastly grin that seemed to mock even in death.

00:33:02,949 --> 00:33:07,069
I turned to Holmes, who gazed upon the scene with stern composure.

00:33:07,069 --> 00:33:10,599
Holmes, I whispered, what in God's name was it?

00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:15,099
The deadliest snake in India, the swamp adder

00:33:15,099 --> 00:33:18,019
Its venom kills within seconds

00:33:18,019 --> 00:33:21,599
Roylott kept it here, trained to enter the girl's room

00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:24,639
By means of the ventilator and the dummy rope

00:33:24,639 --> 00:33:28,579
Lured back by the whistle and the saucer of milk

00:33:28,579 --> 00:33:32,000
Tonight, Watson, it turned upon him

00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,299
And thus the wicked received his due

00:33:35,299 --> 00:33:39,019
And so, in that grim chamber at Stoke Moran

00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:43,809
the shadow lifted from the life of Helen Stoner. The mystery of the speckled band was laid bare,

00:33:43,809 --> 00:33:49,039
though the horror of it would haunt me long after. The dreadful cry that had rung through

00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:55,079
Stope Moran still echoed in my ears as Holmes turned the key upon the safe. Hmm, D.I.L.

00:33:55,079 --> 00:33:59,900
Imprisoning the loathsome serpent within. Wow. The lantern's light flickered across the grotesque

00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:03,900
features of Doctor. Clem is me, Roy Lord. His powerful fame now slackened in death,

00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:07,590
the moths of the snake's bite already darkening upon his brow.

00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:10,510
Holmes, I stammered, my voice unsteady.

00:34:10,510 --> 00:34:12,550
I can scarcely believe what I have seen,

00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,690
to think that such a monstrous plot was hatched beneath this roof,

00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:21,059
that a human being could stoop to murder his own stepchild in so infernal a fashion.

00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:25,269
Holmes' face was grave, but his voice steady.

00:34:25,269 --> 00:34:30,660
The ways of wickedness, Watson, are often more cunning than the ways of virtue.

00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:33,799
Croylott had both the cruelty and the ingenuity

00:34:33,799 --> 00:34:35,779
to devise a scheme which,

00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:38,869
but for chance and your faithful vigilance tonight,

00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:41,409
might have claimed its second victim.

00:34:41,409 --> 00:34:45,880
Yet, in the end, his own weapon has recoiled upon him.

00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:49,579
Justice, though delayed, has not been denied.

00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:51,819
...

00:34:51,819 --> 00:34:54,239
For some minutes we stood in silence,

00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:56,099
contemplating that ghastly scene.

00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:59,159
The silence of the house was broken only by the distant triumphant owl

00:34:59,159 --> 00:35:02,819
and the occasional hiss from the imprisoned adder within the safe.

00:35:02,819 --> 00:35:06,029
At length, Holmes turned away and laid his hand upon my shoulder.

00:35:06,029 --> 00:35:09,300
Come, Watson. Our duty here is done.

00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:12,239
Let us call Miss Stoner and relieve her mind.

00:35:12,239 --> 00:35:14,480
...

00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,039
She need never again know the terror of this room.

00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:19,139
..

00:35:19,139 --> 00:35:21,000
We retraced our steps along the passage,

00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,579
where Helen Stoner awaited us in her own chamber.

00:35:23,579 --> 00:35:27,779
Her pained face was drawn with anxiety and she sprang to her feet as we entered.

00:35:27,779 --> 00:35:31,269
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, what has happened?

00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:35,590
I heard a scream, so dreadful, so unearthly.

00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:37,750
Tell me, what does it mean?

00:35:37,750 --> 00:35:39,820
Holmes regarded her with compassion.

00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:43,690
It means, Miss Stoner, that you are safe.

00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,970
Your stepfather is dead.

00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:53,160
He has perished by the very device with which he sought to destroy you.

00:35:53,159 --> 00:35:57,579
She pressed her hands to her face, overcome with conflicting emotions.

00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:01,279
Relief, sorrow and horror all struggled within her.

00:36:01,279 --> 00:36:04,119
At last she whispered, her voice trembling.

00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:07,250
Dead? Then the nightmare is ended.

00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:09,589
Oh, thank God! Thank God!

00:36:09,589 --> 00:36:16,159
And yet, though he was harsh and violent, he was still my mother's husband.

00:36:16,159 --> 00:36:18,519
I cannot rejoice in his death.

00:36:18,519 --> 00:36:21,799
I cannot rejoice in his death. I...

00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:35,920
nor should you miss stoner said holmes gently but you may rejoice in your deliverance the law would have demanded his punishment providence has taken the matter into its own hands

00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:39,170
She sank into a chair, covering her face with her hands.

00:36:39,170 --> 00:36:43,190
Holmes allowed her a moment's composure before he addressed her again.

00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,030
Miss Stoner, you must rest.

00:36:46,030 --> 00:36:51,340
Tomorrow, when daylight returns, you will be free to leave this place forever.

00:36:51,340 --> 00:36:56,710
The estate will pass into other hands, and you may begin anew.

00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:00,710
Take courage, for your future lies clear before you.

00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:04,619
She looked up, tears glistening in her eyes, and pressed Holmes' hand.

00:37:04,619 --> 00:37:08,840
I owe you my life, Mr. Holmes, yours and Dr. Watson's.

00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,059
How can I ever repay such a debt?

00:37:11,059 --> 00:37:13,289
Holmes bowed gravely.

00:37:13,289 --> 00:37:16,630
Your gratitude is sufficient reward.

00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:19,779
And now, Watson, let us depart.

00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,339
..

00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:24,059
Our task is done.

00:37:24,059 --> 00:37:26,400
We left her with words of reassurance

00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,399
and made our way once more through the desolate house,

00:37:29,399 --> 00:37:31,179
out into the chill night air.

00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,519
The stars were paling, for dawn was near

00:37:33,519 --> 00:37:38,470
and the first faint streaks of light touched the horizon as we passed down the drive.

00:37:38,470 --> 00:37:42,920
Holmes walked swiftly, his cloak wrapped about him, his head bent in thought.

00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:46,789
Holmes, I said at last, I beg you, explain all.

00:37:46,789 --> 00:37:49,220
I understand that Roylott used the snake as his instrument,

00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:51,430
but how could such a scheme have been contrived?

00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,560
And what of the speckled band, the dying words of Julia Stoner?

00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,480
He slowed his pace and turned to me, his features illuminated by the grey dawn.

00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,329
It is simplicity itself, Watson, though diabolical in its ingenuity.

00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:14,519
When Miss Stoner told us of her sister's words, I was struck by the peculiar phrase,

00:38:14,519 --> 00:38:21,460
the speckled band. At first I thought of a band of gypsies, since Roylott had allowed them to camp

00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:27,900
upon his grounds. But the more I considered, the more I felt it must refer to something visible

00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:34,130
and immediate, something that had been present in the room at the very moment of death.

00:38:34,130 --> 00:38:41,800
When I saw the ventilator, the fixed bed and the dummy rope, the whole design became clear.

00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,300
And the whistle, the metallic gland?

00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:52,440
The whistle was the doctor's signal to summon back his trained adder, which he kept in the safe.

00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,819
He had taught it to crawl through the ventilator along the bell-rope and into the bed of the sleeping girl.

00:38:59,819 --> 00:39:04,039
Once there, it would strike, leaving little or no trace.

00:39:04,039 --> 00:39:12,079
In the morning, at his call, it would return by the same path and he would shut it away, giving it milk as its reward.

00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,780
The clang was the closing of the safe door.

00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:16,159
..

00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:21,780
Monstrous, I exclaimed, and to think, he sought to repeat the crime upon Helen as he had upon Julia.

00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:25,460
But why homes? Ha, I know. Why destroy them?

00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:29,650
Money, Watson. The most common motive of all.

00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:35,190
Their mother's will left each daughter a portion of her fortune upon marriage.

00:39:35,190 --> 00:39:40,010
Had both wed, Roylott's income would have been severely reduced.

00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:47,140
To prevent that, he chose to remove them by the surest means his cruel imagination could devise.

00:39:47,139 --> 00:39:53,340
I shook my head, filled with loathing, to think that a man of science could descend to such villainy.

00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:57,099
But, Holmes, how did you know the snake would turn upon him to-night?

00:39:57,099 --> 00:40:03,720
I did not know, but when I lashed at it with my cane, I forced it back through the ventilator.

00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,809
It sought refuge in the nearest warm body, which happened to be its master.

00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:12,699
Roylott's own ingenuity brought about his death.

00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:14,859
He spoke with cold precision

00:40:14,859 --> 00:40:17,960
Yet I could not feign to note a trace of sadness in his tone

00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,859
Holmes, for all his iron composure

00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,659
Was never untouched by the tragedies of human folly

00:40:22,659 --> 00:40:25,599
It is a grim satisfaction, Watson

00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,139
To have saved an innocent life

00:40:28,139 --> 00:40:31,079
Yet it is always a dreadful thing

00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:33,939
When man is slain by man

00:40:33,939 --> 00:40:36,539
Even though justice may approve the act

00:40:36,539 --> 00:40:38,939
We walked on in silence for some time

00:40:38,939 --> 00:40:40,779
The morning brightening around us

00:40:40,779 --> 00:40:42,579
The bird stirring in the hedgerows

00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:46,849
At last we reached the station, where the early train pours back toward London.

00:40:46,849 --> 00:40:52,149
As the wheels clattered upon the rails, I pondered deeply upon the strange events of the night.

00:40:52,149 --> 00:41:00,489
Holmes, I said softly, your genius has once again unraveled a mystery that would have baffled all others to think of the delicate chain of reasoning.

00:41:00,489 --> 00:41:04,069
The ventilator, the bed, the rope, it seems incredible.

00:41:04,069 --> 00:41:06,079
He gave a faint smile.

00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:09,719
You give me too much credit, my dear Watson.

00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:18,769
The problem was singular, but the solution laid plain to any mind that would observe carefully and reason logically.

00:41:18,769 --> 00:41:23,920
Remember always, from trifles, great truths may be deduced.

00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,779
That, after all, is the essence of my method.

00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:35,919
I nodded, though I knew that no amount of study would ever grant me the swift intuition and brilliant deductions of my friend.

00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,200
yet I was proud to have shared in the adventure

00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,819
and prouder still to have stood by his side in the hour of peril.

00:41:41,819 --> 00:41:44,190
And so ends the tale of the speckled band,

00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:47,010
a tale of terror, of cunning and of justice.

00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,820
It remains in my mind one of the darkest and most remarkable cases

00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,240
ever handled by Sherlock Holmes

00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:55,670
and one which proved yet again that in the presence of crime,

00:41:55,670 --> 00:41:58,220
his intellect shone like a beacon in the night.

00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,519
.
