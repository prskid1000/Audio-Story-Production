00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
It has long been my privilege, dear listener, to accompany Sherlock Holmes through a series of

00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,120
adventures which have often placed us in the most curious and perplexing situations.

00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,220
Many of these episodes I have recorded in my journals, and on quiet evenings before the

00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:17,079
hearth at Baker Street, I have occasionally ventured to read them aloud to my companion,

00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:21,039
who though he feigned indifference, would sometimes offer a dry smile when some passage

00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,839
reminded him of the thrill of the chase or the satisfaction of a successful deduction.

00:00:24,839 --> 00:00:25,859
..

00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:29,080
The affair I now set down was one that drew much public notice in its day,

00:00:29,079 --> 00:00:32,230
involving as it did a member of the aristocracy,

00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:35,109
the sudden disappearance of a young American bride,

00:00:35,109 --> 00:00:37,280
you and vote, American bride,

00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,219
and the application of Holmes' singular reasoning powers

00:00:40,219 --> 00:00:43,329
to a case that baffled society and police alike.

00:00:43,329 --> 00:00:45,119
The newspapers gave it the title of

00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,049
The Adventure of the Noble Bachelor.

00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,420
To me, however, it remains first and foremost

00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,000
a story of Holmes' brilliance

00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,879
and of my own humble apprenticeship

00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:54,810
in the science of observation.

00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:57,459
The events began on a bleak October morning.

00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,719
A thin mist had spread itself over the grey roofs of London

00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:05,080
and the drizzle tapped drearily at the windows of our lodgings in Baker Street.

00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:08,960
Holmes was seated cross-legged upon the rug, dressing gown loose about him,

00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,129
his keen eyes fixed on the flames that curled in the grate.

00:01:12,129 --> 00:01:16,240
Before him, scattered upon the carpet, lay a number of freshly printed newspapers.

00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,240
I had only just returned from my early rounds and I found him in that absorbed attitude

00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,500
which betokened the presence of some problem.

00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:24,659
Hmm, Holmes, hmm.

00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:29,319
You seem as intent upon those pages as though they conceal the very secrets of the kingdom.

00:01:29,319 --> 00:01:32,259
What is it that holds your attention so closely?

00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:36,870
The kingdom, my dear Watson, may rest safely for the present.

00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:40,710
It is not treason I study, but matrimony.

00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:43,039
Matrimony! You astound me.

00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:46,879
I should not have suspected you of interest in so domestic a topic.

00:01:46,879 --> 00:01:51,879
Nor am I interested in the sentimental aspect, I assure you.

00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:58,620
My concern lies in the peculiar circumstances surrounding a union much discussed in society,

00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:05,619
circles these last days, that of Lord Robert Saints, Simon, the youngest son of the Duke

00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:12,129
of Balmoral, and a certain Miss Hattie Doran, daughter of a wealthy American.

00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:17,199
He drew one of the papers toward him and pointed to the announcement, where indeed the engagement

00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:19,639
had been chronicled with much flourish.

00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:25,430
Observe, Watson, a nobleman of ancient lineage, though without vast means,

00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,329
takes to wife a young lady of considerable fortune.

00:02:29,329 --> 00:02:35,930
Such alliances are common enough in our age, but the aftermath, ah, there lies the matter of interest.

00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,229
The bride has vanished, Watson. She disappeared upon her wedding morning.

00:02:41,229 --> 00:02:44,859
Vanished? Surely you do not mean she has been abducted?

00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:49,560
That is one possibility, though not the most probable.

00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,440
Here, read these accounts.

00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:14,860
.......................

00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,570
she had fled of her own accord,

00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,090
others that some misadventure had befallen her.

00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,960
The police were engaged upon the case,

00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,650
but as yet without result.

00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:24,760
This is certainly a singular occurrence.

00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,140
And Lord St. Simon, how does he bear the matter?

00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,890
According to the report,

00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:30,030
with dignity,

00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:33,020
though not without visible irritation,

00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,820
he has placed himself

00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:37,880
in communication with Scotland Yard

00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,509
and Lestrade has the conduct of the case.

00:03:41,509 --> 00:03:44,629
Then no doubt the mystery will soon be unraveled.

00:03:44,629 --> 00:03:58,420
my dear fellow lestrade is energetic but not always illuminating this affair requires delicate handling for there are undercurrents which the official mind does not readily perceive

00:03:58,419 --> 00:04:02,719
He paused, stretched out his long arm, and plucked another journal from the heap.

00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,659
His quick eyes ran down the columns.

00:04:04,659 --> 00:04:07,519
Ah, just as I surmised.

00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,659
The father, Mr. Francis Duran, is described as a man of rough speech,

00:04:13,659 --> 00:04:20,740
but of sterling qualities, a Californian, who amassed his fortune in the mines.

00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:26,620
The daughter, Hattie, is said to be high-spirited, with a certain independence of manner,

00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:29,759
which is scarcely surprising given her origin.

00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,250
Note this also.

00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:36,670
She was reported to have been attended by a former suitor, a certain mister.

00:04:36,670 --> 00:04:40,370
Frances Moulton, shortly after her arrival in England.

00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:43,780
That name may not be without significance.

00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:47,220
You think this Mr. Moulton has some connection with her disappearance?

00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,860
I neither affirm nor deny.

00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,490
I merely note the possibility.

00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:55,399
Remember, Watson, that in the problem of disappearance,

00:04:55,399 --> 00:05:01,269
one must first determine whether the person has vanished voluntarily or by compulsion.

00:05:01,269 --> 00:05:04,079
That distinction is fundamental.

00:05:04,079 --> 00:05:05,099
..

00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:07,699
He leaned back, clasped his hands behind his head

00:05:07,699 --> 00:05:12,250
and regarded me with that quiet smile which so often accompanied his instruction.

00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:16,610
What do you yourself infer from the facts as presented?

00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:19,069
Well, if I may hazard a guess,

00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:22,539
it seems unlikely that a young lady would abandon her noble husband

00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,120
on the very day of marriage without grave reason.

00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:28,439
might she not have been yawed away or forced from the house?

00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:30,680
A reasonable supposition.

00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:35,480
Yet reflect also upon the independence of her character,

00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,410
her previous acquaintance with another gentleman,

00:05:38,410 --> 00:05:41,039
and the suddenness of her disappearance.

00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,620
If she fled of her own accord,

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,560
those circumstances would harmonize.

00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,170
If she were abducted, why should no cry be heard, no trace left?

00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:54,160
True, I had not considered that.

00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:09,160
then again watson never neglect the minor details consider her dress her ornaments her behavior at the breakfast table such trifles properly observed may speak volumes

00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:23,840
as he spoke mrs hudson entered with a card upon a tray holmes took it up glanced at the inscription and passed it to me it bore the name of lord robert walsingham de veris and simon

00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:29,279
Our noble client is at the door. Let us admit him without delay.

00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:37,129
In another moment there entered a tall, aristocratic figure, thin of face, with hop-like features and a certain languid, haughtiness of manner.

00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:41,220
His frock coat was spotlessly cut and a single red rose adorned his buttonhole.

00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:46,769
Yet despite his composure, there lurked upon his countenance a trace of vexation not to be disguised.

00:06:46,769 --> 00:06:52,539
Mr. Holmes, I presume I have come to you because the situation in which I find myself is beyond the capacity of the police.

00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:56,780
As he adds he adds, I cannot endure the indignity of public conjecture.

00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,759
My bride, my wife, has disappeared, and I demand that you trace her.

00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,020
Tray be seated. Lord St. Simon, this is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson.

00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:10,040
We are already acquainted with the broad facts of the case through the press,

00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:13,420
but your own account will naturally be more precise.

00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,830
Then I shall be brief.

00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,040
Yesterday, as all the world knows, I was united to Miss Hattie de Horan,

00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,259
daughter of Mr. Istanbul, Francis de Horan of San Francisco.

00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:23,740
Sure, the ceremony passed without incident.

00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:27,079
My bride seemed somewhat agitated, but I ascribed it to natural noseness.

00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:30,659
At the breakfast afterwards she excused herself, and from that moment I have seen her no more.

00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:33,199
The search of the house proved fruitless.

00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:36,659
Later inquiries revealed that she was observed in Hyde Park in company with a gentleman.

00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,500
Since then, nothing.

00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,959
This is indeed most remarkable.

00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:43,539
You say she was observed with a gentleman.

00:07:43,539 --> 00:07:45,019
Can you describe him?

00:07:45,019 --> 00:07:47,159
Unfortunately, the description is vague.

00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:49,379
A tall man with a moustache?

00:07:49,379 --> 00:07:51,049
That is all that could be learned.

00:07:51,049 --> 00:08:08,879
and what of your relations with your bride before the wedding did you notice any circumstance which might bear upon this sudden flight none whatever i paid her the usual attentions she accepted them graciously her father was most anxious for the union and i myself was sincerely attached to her

00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:20,579
sincerely attached you say forgive me lord saintst simon if i press a delicate point was the marriage one of affection or of convenience

00:08:20,579 --> 00:08:30,199
with haughte sir i am a nobleman my house is ancient and my purse is light the lady brought wealth i brought position it was a suitable alliance but i did not lack regard for her

00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:41,740
quite so and now one final question did your bride receive any communication letter or token upon the morning of the wedding

00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:57,980
hesitates now that you mention it i recall that a note was handed to her as we left the church she read it turned pale and crushed it into her glove i thought it a trifle perhaps some girlish congratulation that my lord may prove the most important fact of all

00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,720
Holmes leaned back, his eyes half closed, as though assembling the various threads in his mind,

00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:07,100
I for my part, was already marvelling at the possibilities which the case suggested.

00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:09,930
Thus began the strange adventure of the noble bachelor,

00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,509
one of the most singular episodes it has ever been my fortune to share with Sherlock Holmes.

00:09:14,509 --> 00:09:16,210
Hmm, Lord St. Hmm.

00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:21,990
Simon sat erect upon the settee, the faintest suggestion of irritation upon his refined features,

00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:26,070
as though his very dignity chafed against the necessity of explanation.

00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:28,950
Holmes, however, remained perfectly at ease,

00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,840
his long fingers steeply together,

00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,320
his gaze fixed with quiet intensity upon our client.

00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:38,700
You mention, my lord, that a note was delivered to your bride

00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,910
at the very door of the church.

00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,129
Do you recall by whom it was handed to her?

00:09:44,129 --> 00:09:45,940
A small page boy, I believe,

00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:47,840
a messenger from one of the attendants, perhaps.

00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,620
I paid little attention, being myself occupied

00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:51,590
with the congratulations of my friends.

00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:54,320
And the note itself, you did not see it?

00:09:54,320 --> 00:10:11,960
no sir she read it hastily pale visibly and thrust it into her glove i thought no more of it until her disappearance did she carry the note with her when she left the house in lancaster gate i cannot say if she did it has not been found just howard i go to

00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:17,250
A more curious circumstance, indeed. A sudden letter on the very threshold of matrimony,

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:20,890
and vanishing thereafter, surely the two events are connected.

00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:29,139
Just so, Watson, we must treat them as contiguous phenomena. Now, my lord, you mentioned that Miss

00:10:29,139 --> 00:10:34,750
Doran was observed later in Hyde Park with a gentleman who was the observer.

00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:38,800
One of the footmen from my father-in-law's household, he stated that he saw a lady

00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:43,349
resembling my wife, in company with a tall man with a moustache, walking beside the serpentine.

00:10:43,349 --> 00:10:51,049
He swears to her identity. Did he hear them speak? No, only that they appeared absorbed in each other,

00:10:51,049 --> 00:10:59,419
walking arm in arm. That is very suggestive. Tell me further, Lord Saint. Simon, did your wife show

00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:07,509
any peculiarities of demeanour on the days preceding the wedding? Any reluctance? Any agitation?

00:11:07,509 --> 00:11:10,140
I cannot deny that she was somewhat restless.

00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,380
At the rehearsal she seemed preoccupied.

00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,220
At one moment I found her in tears,

00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:17,870
though she quickly explained them as the result of parting from her father's American friends.

00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:23,000
Ah, at this, Mr. Francis Morton, was he one of those friends?

00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,950
With a frown, I have heard the name, yes.

00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,080
It was said to be an acquaintance of hers in California,

00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:30,029
but I gave the matter no thought.

00:11:30,029 --> 00:11:34,080
And yet, my lord, you now come to me precisely because such acquaintances,

00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:41,230
acquaintances, when overlooked, proved to be the very key to the enigma. At this quiet remark,

00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:46,840
Lord Saint, why't? Simon flushed slightly, but he restrained his irritation, perhaps mindful that

00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:51,450
he had placed himself in Holmes's hands. I'm not here to argue, sir, but to learn the truth,

00:11:51,450 --> 00:11:57,360
if this Mr. Smith, a murtan, has spirited my wife away, then let him be found and punished.

00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:05,039
Unished? My lord, let us not anticipate. It may prove, rather, that some former obligation has

00:12:05,039 --> 00:12:12,379
reasserted itself. You mean another marriage? I hinted nothing. I merely keep the avenues of

00:12:12,379 --> 00:12:19,329
inference open. Combs rose and began pacing the carpet, his dressing gown sweeping behind him,

00:12:19,329 --> 00:12:24,139
his long, humorous, nervous fingers flicking idly at the air as though he plucked threads

00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:25,889
from the unseen room of fate.

00:12:25,889 --> 00:12:28,500
Tell me, Lord St. Simon,

00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,819
what of the clothing your bride wore at her disappearance?

00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:32,899
..

00:12:32,899 --> 00:12:35,299
She had upon her the same dress in which she was married,

00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:37,450
white satin, if I mistake not,

00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:39,360
with a spray orange blossom.

00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,879
She wore also her wedding ring, of course,

00:12:40,879 --> 00:12:42,639
and a small diamond brooch, which was my gift.

00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:43,740
..

00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:44,799
And her veil?

00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,340
..

00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,559
She had removed it after the ceremony.

00:12:48,559 --> 00:12:49,700
Very good.

00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,840
Was there any quarrel between yourself and your bride?

00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
Hmm, none whatever.

00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:55,840
Hmm.

00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,840
Then the facts are thus.

00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:08,840
A bride receives a note at the church, reads it with agitation, conceals it, proceeds to her father's house, then vanishes.

00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,840
She is seen with a gentleman in Hyde Park.

00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,840
The police are at fort because they lack imagination.

00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,840
For myself, the case is transparent.

00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,840
Transparent homes? Surely not already.

00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:28,600
My dear Watson, to see is easy when one knows where to look.

00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,870
He resumed his seat and fixed Lord St. Simon with a penetrating glance.

00:13:32,870 --> 00:13:39,050
My lord, you will, I trust, excuse a frankness which is necessary.

00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,280
You married Miss Hattie Duran for her wealth and she married you for your title.

00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:48,140
There is no shame in acknowledging the truth.

00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:51,779
But she had, it appears, a prior tie.

00:13:51,779 --> 00:13:56,000
A bond of the heart stronger than that of ambition.

00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,700
That bond reasserted itself at the very altar.

00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:00,820
..

00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:03,379
Angrily, you dare insinuate.

00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:05,550
I insinuate nothing.

00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:08,620
I merely read the facts as they lie.

00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:12,650
Whether she has fled to her former lover or has been taken by him,

00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,870
the result is the same.

00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,720
Your wife is absent.

00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,600
Our task is to trace her and to secure her safety.

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,670
And what of my honour, sir?

00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:29,639
Dear, your honour, my lord, must stand upon the truth, not upon illusion.

00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:33,700
For a moment, the young nobleman seemed about to make an indignant retort.

00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,980
Then, perceiving perhaps the futility of contention, he rose with dignity.

00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,710
Very well, Mr. Holmes, I place myself in your hands.

00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:43,120
Discover the truth, whatever it may be.

00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,160
You shall hear from me within twenty-four hours.

00:14:47,159 --> 00:14:52,689
With a stiff bow to us both, Lord St. Simon withdrew, his footsteps echoing down the stairs.

00:14:52,689 --> 00:14:57,250
The door had scarcely closed behind him before I turned eagerly to my companion.

00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:03,549
Holmes, you amaze me. You speak as though the matter were already solved, yet we possess so little tangible evidence.

00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:07,779
Evidence, Watson, is always sufficient if properly read.

00:15:07,779 --> 00:15:14,379
Consider the note at the church, the agitation, the disappearance, the sighting in the park.

00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:18,379
These form a sequence, too consistent for chance.

00:15:18,379 --> 00:15:19,950
Um, who?

00:15:19,950 --> 00:15:24,069
And yet we know nothing of this gentleman, nothing of where they went.

00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:26,590
That is precisely what we shall learn.

00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:28,509
But the main principle is clear.

00:15:28,509 --> 00:15:30,759
The lady left willingly.

00:15:30,759 --> 00:15:33,190
Then you do not suspect foul play?

00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,779
Not in the least.

00:15:34,779 --> 00:15:39,079
Had she been forced, there would be some struggle, some alarm.

00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:42,679
Instead, she walked calmly with her companion.

00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:46,919
Holmes took up one of the newspapers and tacked it with his finger.

00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:49,329
Observe this notice, Watson.

00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:55,719
Mr. Francis Doran has offered a reward for information regarding his daughter.

00:15:55,719 --> 00:16:00,969
That in itself shows he is ignorant of her intentions.

00:16:00,969 --> 00:16:07,480
And yet, she would hardly abandon him, save under the strongest compulsion of affection.

00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,579
You mean, Mr. Francis Moulton?

00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,100
precisely

00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,500
we must discover his whereabouts

00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,920
at this moment there came a brisk

00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,960
knock at the door and Mrs. Bela Hudson

00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,100
ushered in a stout bustling figure

00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,060
with sharp eyes and a familiar air

00:16:22,060 --> 00:16:23,759
of self importance it was

00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:25,580
Inspector Lestrade of Scotland Yard

00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:28,180
ha Mr. Holmes good day to you

00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:29,980
I thought I should find you poring over

00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,020
this noble bedding business quite the scandal

00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,980
eh well I have a mind to

00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:36,259
lay my hands on the fellow that carried her off

00:16:36,259 --> 00:16:38,259
and who is the fellow

00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:39,480
Lestrade

00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:43,230
Smugly, why some rogue she picked up in America, no doubt.

00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,000
We shall comb the docks and nab him yet.

00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,889
Admirable energy, as always.

00:16:48,889 --> 00:16:54,360
But may I inquire, have you considered the possibility that the lady departed willingly?

00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,620
..

00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,519
Willingly? Nonsense.

00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:01,059
What bride deserts her husband on the very day of marriage?

00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:05,509
No, no, Holmes, there's villainy here, and we shall find it.

00:17:05,509 --> 00:17:08,670
Smiling faintly, we shall see.

00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:13,489
Lestrade bustled about the room, imparting a few inconsequential details of his inquiries.

00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:16,309
Omen then took his leave with an air of confidence.

00:17:16,309 --> 00:17:18,739
Holmes watched him go with an amused expression.

00:17:18,739 --> 00:17:23,539
Poor Lestrade! He works with vigour but without vision.

00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:26,969
And you, Holmes, what course shall you pursue?

00:17:26,969 --> 00:17:29,269
The simplest of all.

00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:32,469
I shall insert a small notice in the evening papers,

00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:36,319
couched in terms which our quarry cannot fail to recognise.

00:17:36,319 --> 00:17:42,639
By this means, Watson, I shall bring the lady and her companion to our very door.

00:17:42,639 --> 00:17:44,639
You expect them to come here?

00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:50,880
Where else? When the bird is weary of flight, it will return to the nest of reason.

00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:59,659
He seated himself at the table, drew forth pen and ink, and in a few deft strokes composed an advertisement which, I confess, I found most enigmatic.

00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:04,759
It ran thus. Would the gentleman who accompanied a lady in white satin at Hyde Park yesterday

00:18:04,759 --> 00:18:09,220
kindly communicate with Mr. Poor, Sherlock Holmes, 221 B Baker Street,

00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:13,539
regarding a matter of utmost importance? And you think this will suffice?

00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:18,420
It must, for the lady and her companion cannot long remain hidden.

00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:24,759
Their very secrecy will drive them to seek explanation, and I am the natural medium.

00:18:24,759 --> 00:18:31,230
He laid aside the pen with an air of finality, lit his pipe and leaned back in his chair,

00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,630
his eyes gleaming with quiet confidence.

00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:36,759
I, for my part, could not repress his sense of wonder.

00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:38,909
To me, the case seemed zapped in shadows.

00:18:38,909 --> 00:18:41,259
To him, it was as clear as day.

00:18:41,259 --> 00:18:43,079
Thus, the stage was set.

00:18:43,079 --> 00:18:45,720
We awaited only the response to Holmes' stratagem,

00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,680
certain that the mystery of the missing bride was drawing swiftly toward a dramatic solution.

00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:55,820
The advertisement, once dispatched to the evening papers, in all breasts,

00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,869
thanked, seemed to me, a fray and reed upon which to lean such weighty hopes.

00:18:59,869 --> 00:19:02,570
Yet my companion showed no trace of uncertainty.

00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:03,440
You me!

00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,039
He sat calmly smoking, or stretched languidly upon the city,

00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:10,470
his keen gaze wandering now to the ceiling, now to the fire,

00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:15,110
as though he saw the very pattern of truth written upon the smoke and the flames.

00:19:15,110 --> 00:19:19,320
Holmes, forgive me if I appear dull, but I cannot, for the life of me,

00:19:19,319 --> 00:19:21,980
perceive how a mere notice in the standard is

00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:25,639
to draw a vanished bride and her prestigious companion to our door.

00:19:25,639 --> 00:19:29,079
My dear Watson, you resemble the rustic

00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:31,319
who watches the conjurer's performance

00:19:31,319 --> 00:19:34,649
and marvels at the rabbit's appearance,

00:19:34,649 --> 00:19:38,650
but never observes the deft hand that concealed it.

00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,839
The advertisement is not the rabbit, but the hat.

00:19:41,839 --> 00:19:46,779
The lady's companion must scan the newspapers with anxious eye,

00:19:46,779 --> 00:19:52,659
for he knows the hue and cry is abroad when he sees that one man.

00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:57,269
Sherlock Holmes does not threaten, but invites communication.

00:19:57,269 --> 00:20:00,379
He will recognize a chance to explain himself.

00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:03,740
You suppose, then, that he is guiltless?

00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:10,079
Not guiltless, perhaps, but not criminal, in the sense Lestrade conceives.

00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:18,439
Love is not larceny, Watson, nor does affection constitute abduction.

00:20:18,439 --> 00:20:40,079
......................

00:20:40,079 --> 00:20:45,199
chronicle of conjectures. At length I retired, yet scarcely had I drifted into slumber when the

00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:49,539
thought of the missing bride, wandering perhaps friendless in the night, awoke me again and again.

00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:50,619
..

00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:54,589
It was about eleven o'clock the next morning when our bell rang with a sharp peal.

00:20:54,589 --> 00:20:59,230
Mrs. Egg Jenga! Hudson entered with her habitual air of patient wonder,

00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:04,299
bearing the guard of a visitor. Holmes glanced at it, and a smile played upon his lips.

00:21:04,299 --> 00:21:08,200
Ah, Watson, the fish has risen to the bait

00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:12,159
Play, compose yourself for an interview of some delicacy

00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:15,000
A moment later our visitor was shown

00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,279
In a woman, plainly dressed, her face pale with anxiety

00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:20,299
Her eyes bright with resolution

00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:22,759
She was of middle years, perhaps forty

00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:25,680
Yet there lingered in her features a faded beauty

00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:28,319
And an expression of habitual endurance

00:21:28,319 --> 00:21:31,200
She curtsied slightly, then sank into the chair

00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,179
Holmes indicated, so

00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:35,409
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I presume?

00:21:35,409 --> 00:21:38,599
Sir, I beg you will excuse the liberty of my coming.

00:21:38,599 --> 00:21:39,799
..

00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:42,429
I saw your notice in the paper this morning,

00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:47,820
and I thought it my duty, yes, my duty, to tell you what I know.

00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:49,539
Your name, madam?

00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,909
Fowler, Mrs. Flora.

00:21:51,909 --> 00:21:55,000
Fowler, I am, sir, a lady's maid.

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,799
The maid of Miss Hattie Doran, perhaps?

00:21:57,799 --> 00:21:58,859
..

00:21:58,859 --> 00:22:02,740
Ah, yes, sir, her maid, since she landed in this country.

00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:05,269
and it is for her sake I am here.

00:22:05,269 --> 00:22:06,650
For though she has gone,

00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,879
I would not have the word think ill of her.

00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,940
...

00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:14,640
No one who has read your mistress's character aright

00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,710
could think ill of her.

00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:20,199
But pray, proceed, Mrs. Fowler,

00:22:20,199 --> 00:22:22,180
tell us what you observed.

00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,119
Well, sir, on the morning of the wedding

00:22:25,119 --> 00:22:27,230
I was with her as she dressed.

00:22:27,230 --> 00:22:29,259
She was pale, fairly pale,

00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,210
and trembled as I fastened her gown.

00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:34,550
More than once, she clasped my hand and said,

00:22:34,550 --> 00:22:37,680
Oh, Flora, I wish this day were over.

00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:42,340
I thought it but maidenly nerves, though I confess my heart misgave me.

00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:46,620
Then, at the church, I saw a slip of paper handed to her.

00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,430
She turned as white as her veil, and her lips moved as if she prayed.

00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:55,420
After that, sir, she was like a creature walking in a dream.

00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,180
And after the ceremony?

00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,920
At Lancaster Gate, she whispered to me,

00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,889
If anyone should ask for me, Flora, say nothing.

00:23:02,889 --> 00:23:04,589
Remember, say nothing.

00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:06,380
Then she slipped from the room.

00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:07,799
I never saw her again.

00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,360
Who's Orel?

00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,019
Did she leave by the front door?

00:23:12,019 --> 00:23:13,860
No, sir.

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:17,220
By the side entrance, as if she would avoid observation.

00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:20,549
And you have heard nothing since?

00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:22,170
Nothing, sir.

00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,599
But I know this.

00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:27,289
She loved another before ever she met Lord St. Simon.

00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:31,359
And if that other called her, she would follow him to the world's end.

00:23:31,359 --> 00:23:34,469
You speak of Mr. Francis Morton?

00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:36,460
Star-tiled. You know his name?

00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,679
Yes, he it was.

00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:38,799
..

00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:40,049
That is enough.

00:23:40,049 --> 00:23:42,719
You have acted wisely, Mrs. Fowler,

00:23:42,719 --> 00:23:45,480
and you have relieved your conscience.

00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,309
You may rest assured your mistress is in safe hands.

00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,839
God bless you, sir.

00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:58,360
With a grateful curtsy, the woman withdrew. Holmes watched her departure with a look of quiet satisfaction.

00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,380
To Moldau.

00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:06,230
Well, Holmes, your surmise is confirmed. The lady fled willingly to join this molten. Yet, how should we trace them?

00:24:06,230 --> 00:24:10,359
By waiting, Watson. They will trace themselves.

00:24:10,359 --> 00:24:13,549
Had scarcely uttered the words when once more the bell pealed.

00:24:13,549 --> 00:24:19,240
To know, this time a heavy step was heard upon the stair, and Mrs. Hudson announced, Mr. Francis Moulton.

00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:27,809
Our visitor was a man of strong build, bronzed by sun and wind, with frank, earnest eyes and the carriage of one accustomed to command.

00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:32,920
He entered hastily, as though impatience drove him, and addressed Holmes without preamble.

00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:37,789
Mr. Holmes, I have read your notice. You can save me from a cruel misunderstanding.

00:24:37,789 --> 00:24:40,849
My wife is with me, sir, my lawful wife.

00:24:40,849 --> 00:24:42,240
Your wife? But...

00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:53,099
Pay be seated, Mr. Moten. You interest us exceedingly. If you will favor us with your narrative, the truth shall soon be set right.

00:24:53,099 --> 00:25:12,240
....................

00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,869
and lay long between life and death.

00:25:14,869 --> 00:25:17,420
News reached Hattie that I had perished.

00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:20,289
She believed herself a widow.

00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:24,659
Were you, in fact, recovered and only later returned?

00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:25,769
Just so.

00:25:25,769 --> 00:25:28,130
When at last I came to England to seek her,

00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:30,990
I found she had been courted by Lord St. Simon.

00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,599
Her father urged the match,

00:25:32,599 --> 00:25:36,329
and she, believing herself free, consented.

00:25:36,329 --> 00:25:37,700
I had but one hope,

00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,380
to see her before the ceremony and claim my rights.

00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:42,159
But I arrived too late.

00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:57,539
she was already at the church i sent her a note she knew my hand and she came to me as any true wife must extraordinary and where is she now at lodgings not far from here trembling lest the world brand her faithless

00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:02,300
I would shoo her from scandal, sir, but I cannot bear that she be slain as a runaway bride,

00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,420
when in truth she but returned to her husband.

00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,619
..

00:26:05,619 --> 00:26:08,559
You have done rightly to come to me, Mr. Modin.

00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:15,019
The truth must be told, though gently, for Lord St. Simon's pride is involved.

00:26:15,019 --> 00:26:16,099
..

00:26:16,099 --> 00:26:20,739
I have no wish to wound him, but my hattie is mine, and no man shall part us.

00:26:20,739 --> 00:26:24,180
His voice rang with a passion that left no doubt of his sincerity.

00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:27,519
Holmes regarded him thoughtfully for a moment, then rose with decision,

00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:31,559
Bring your wife here at once, Mr. Moulton.

00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:35,190
It is better that all parties meet beneath my roof,

00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:40,019
where the explanation may be made without unseemly publicity.

00:26:40,019 --> 00:26:42,589
I shall fetch her instantly.

00:26:42,589 --> 00:26:45,549
He hurried from the room.

00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:47,500
I turned to Holmes in amazement.

00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,269
Holmes, this is astounding.

00:26:49,269 --> 00:26:51,480
Who would have dreamed of such a solution?

00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,000
Anyone who reasoned from the facts, my dear Watson.

00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,259
But to conceal a prior marriage, surely the lady acted indiscreetly?

00:27:00,259 --> 00:27:01,279
..

00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,429
Indiscreet, perhaps.

00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:08,590
But she believed herself free, and her error was born of grief, not guile.

00:27:08,590 --> 00:27:10,539
We had but a short time to wait.

00:27:10,539 --> 00:27:12,710
In less than half an hour, Boutin returned,

00:27:12,710 --> 00:27:16,710
leading by the hand a young lady whose beauty shone even through her pallor.

00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:20,150
She was tall, graceful, with eyes of deep blue,

00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,700
and a proud carriage softened by distress.

00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:25,960
As she entered, she glanced timidly from Holmes to myself.

00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,880
then clung more closely to her companion's arm.

00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:31,900
Mr. Holmes, I am Hattie Moulton,

00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,889
or Hattie St. Simon, as the world would call me.

00:27:34,889 --> 00:27:37,699
Oh, sir, what must you think of me?

00:27:37,699 --> 00:27:42,950
That you are a lady placed in a position of singular difficulty,

00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,819
and that you have borne it with courage.

00:27:45,819 --> 00:27:46,880
..

00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:49,269
But the shame, the scandal!

00:27:49,269 --> 00:27:53,299
I would have spared Lord St. Simon the pain,

00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,180
yet how could I forsake my true husband?

00:27:56,180 --> 00:27:57,319
..

00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:00,089
You could not, madam, nor should you.

00:28:00,089 --> 00:28:03,880
The truth once spoken will justify you.

00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:06,940
She sank into a chair, covering her face with her hands,

00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:08,980
while her husband bent tenderly over her.

00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,369
I confess, my heart was touched by the sight.

00:28:11,369 --> 00:28:13,069
For all her wealth and beauty,

00:28:13,069 --> 00:28:16,069
she was but a woman torn between duty and affection,

00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,899
and affection had conquered.

00:28:17,899 --> 00:28:21,819
Courage, madam, the hour of explanation approaches.

00:28:21,819 --> 00:28:28,119
I have sent for Lord Saint's Simon, and he will soon be here.

00:28:28,119 --> 00:28:31,339
Starting up. Sent for him?

00:28:31,339 --> 00:28:34,579
Oh, sir, I dread that meeting.

00:28:34,579 --> 00:28:38,799
And you? I dread that meeting.

00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,339
..

00:28:40,339 --> 00:28:42,940
Yet it must be faced.

00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:46,799
Better under my roof, where calm counsel may prevail,

00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,200
than in the glare of society's gossip.

00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:54,720
At this very moment the sound of wheels was heard, and soon after, a knock upon the door.

00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:58,090
Mrs. A. Hudson announced, Lord Robert St. Simon.

00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,030
Holmes's glance met mine.

00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:04,360
Steady, Watson. The curtain rises upon our final act.

00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,400
..

00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,700
Lord Robert St. Lord Robert St.

00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:12,789
Try it is. Simon entered our sitting room with the air of a man who would sooner have been anywhere else,

00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:15,960
yet whose pride compelled him to maintain an unruffled composure.

00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,300
His tall figure was effect, his manner studiedly cold,

00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:24,730
though I detected a tremor about the nostrils and a quickness in his glance which betrayed inner agitation.

00:29:24,730 --> 00:29:27,880
Holmes advanced courteously, motioning him to a chair.

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,639
My lord, I thank you for your punctuality.

00:29:31,639 --> 00:29:37,100
Permit me to present to you Mr. Francis Moten and his wife.

00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,120
..

00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,759
The nobleman's eyes flashed to the couple who rose as he entered.

00:29:40,759 --> 00:29:47,440
For one instant he stood rigid, as though every drop of blood had left his veins.

00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:52,859
Then his lips compressed, and with a slight intonation of the head, he took the seat indicated.

00:29:52,859 --> 00:29:57,289
Mr. Holmes, you promised me the truth. I perceive that it is before me in flesh and blood.

00:29:57,289 --> 00:30:00,500
Rising, trembling Lord St. Simon.

00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:08,289
Oh, sir, forgive me. I never wished to wrong you. I thought, I believed.

00:30:08,289 --> 00:30:10,700
You believed yourself free, madam.

00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:14,269
and therefore you pledged me vows which were not yours to give.

00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:19,619
Willingly, not knowingly, my heart was buried with Frank.

00:30:19,619 --> 00:30:21,869
Or so I thought, or so I thought.

00:30:21,869 --> 00:30:25,670
When he returned, I was bound to him as ever.

00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:28,099
Oh, believe me, I suffered.

00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:29,680
..

00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,670
Firmly, my lord, fault lies not with her but with fate.

00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,619
She deemed me dead, yet I lived.

00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:39,619
Would you have had her deny her husband when once she knew the truth?

00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:45,309
Sir, I have no quarrel with you. The lady was deceived, but not by you. I accept that.

00:30:45,309 --> 00:30:47,949
Yet I cannot disguise the humiliation I endure.

00:30:47,949 --> 00:30:53,159
To be deserted upon my wedding day, to become the jest of society, such wounds cut deep.

00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:58,979
And yet, my lord, you emerge from this affair with honour intact.

00:30:58,979 --> 00:31:03,669
Your pride may be wounded, but your integrity is unblemished.

00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:08,539
It would be known that you were the victim of circumstance, not of corkwetly.

00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:12,539
Indeed, Lord St. Simon, no man could blame you.

00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:18,610
The nobleman's eyes softened slightly as he regarded Hattie, who stood pale and trembling beside her husband.

00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:21,269
Adam, I forgive you, but I cannot forget.

00:31:21,269 --> 00:31:26,859
No, you will, I trust, withdraw from the circle where your brief presence has caused so much disturbance.

00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:30,179
We ask nothing else, my lord.

00:31:30,179 --> 00:31:34,630
Frank and I shall return to America where none can reproach us.

00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,059
And we shall bless you for your generosity.

00:31:37,059 --> 00:31:42,000
Coldly, I do not seek your blessing, sir, but I wish you no ill.

00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,809
The tension of the scene was broken by Holmes,

00:31:44,809 --> 00:31:49,059
who rose and stood between the parties with the air of a judge pronouncing sentence.

00:31:49,059 --> 00:31:51,500
Let us consider the matter closed.

00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,599
..

00:31:52,599 --> 00:31:54,579
The truth is plain.

00:31:54,579 --> 00:32:00,019
The lady exonerated, and your lordship's honour beyond reproach.

00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:05,630
Society may chatter for a week, but it will soon turn to some newer scandal.

00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:09,519
Meanwhile, all hearts may be at rest.

00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:11,180
Oh, with a bitter smile.

00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,640
Elementary, no doubt, Mr. Holmes.

00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,040
..

00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,289
Precisely, my lord.

00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:16,360
Elementary.

00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,960
With a bow that was half courteous, half disdainful,

00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:22,170
Lord St. Simon rose and took his leave.

00:32:22,170 --> 00:32:24,780
We heard his cab rattle away into the London streets.

00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:27,320
For some moments, silence waned in our little room.

00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,450
Then Hattie sank weeping upon the sofa,

00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,059
her husband's arm about her,

00:32:31,059 --> 00:32:32,960
while Holmes busied himself with his pipe,

00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:36,740
as though the drama he had engineered were no more than a passing trifle.

00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:40,329
Holmes, you bear yourself as though nothing remarkable had occurred,

00:32:40,329 --> 00:32:44,720
yet we have just witnessed one of the most extraordinary scenes in our experience.

00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,370
My dear Watson, extraordinary only to the uninitiated.

00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:55,079
To me, it was the inevitable resolution of given premises.

00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:56,100
..

00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,319
Still, you must allow me to marvel at the neatness with which it has ended.

00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:03,579
Meatness is the very essence of deduction.

00:33:03,579 --> 00:33:10,139
When the reasoning is correct, the conclusion follows as surey as day from dawn.

00:33:10,139 --> 00:33:14,619
Hoy, turn then to our guests, whose emotion had somewhat abated.

00:33:14,619 --> 00:33:20,720
Mr. and Mrs. Moulton, you may rest assured that no further impediment lies before you.

00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:29,289
I advise you to depart quietly for America as you propose and to resume the life unjustly interrupted.

00:33:29,289 --> 00:33:32,190
Mr. Holmes, how can we thank you?

00:33:32,190 --> 00:33:36,659
By forgetting me, madam, and remembering only each other

00:33:36,659 --> 00:33:41,519
Yet we shall never forget that you saved my wife from dishonour

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,259
I saved her only from misconception

00:33:44,259 --> 00:33:48,599
The truth was her own, and truth is the strongest advocate

00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:53,460
With words of gratitude, they departed, leaving us once more alone

00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:58,839
I sat back, drawing a deep breath, still half incredulous of the swift unfolding of events

00:33:58,839 --> 00:34:03,619
Holmes, you have unraveled this tangled skein with astonishing swiftness

00:34:03,619 --> 00:34:04,919
Yet I cannot but wonder

00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:09,380
At what moment did you first divine the existence of a prior marriage?

00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:12,639
At the church door, Watson, figuratively speaking

00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,039
A bride receives a note and becomes agitated to the point of pallor

00:34:18,039 --> 00:34:22,019
What message could so move her at such a moment?

00:34:22,019 --> 00:34:27,759
Only one, that the man she truly loved and believed lost still lived

00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:31,520
From that instant, the path was straight.

00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,890
Yet you spoke of possibilities, of abduction, of other causes.

00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:43,310
My dear fellow, one must allow for alternative explanations until the decisive fact is verified.

00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:45,620
But inwardly I was convinced.

00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:49,280
He smiled at my expression, half amused, half reproachful.

00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,880
Come, Watson, you must cultivate the faculty of imagination, disciplined imagination.

00:34:55,880 --> 00:35:00,800
Facts are seeds. Imagination is the soil.

00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:07,050
Deduction is the harvest. Without imagination, facts remain barren.

00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:12,440
I see, Holmes. Yet I confess, the soil of my imagination is but poor compared with yours.

00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,579
..

00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:17,760
Dryly. It is a matter of cultivation, not fertility.

00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,240
For some time, we sat in companionable silence, the fire crackling,

00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:29,019
Cousin, the fall pressing against the window panes, at length, home stirred and drew a fresh sheaf of newspapers toward him.

00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:52,239
........................

00:35:52,239 --> 00:35:55,679
And you, Holmes, what remains for you?

00:35:55,679 --> 00:36:01,639
For me, nothing, save the satisfaction of having read the problem aright.

00:36:01,639 --> 00:36:06,609
And for me, the satisfaction of having witnessed again the triumph of your method.

00:36:06,609 --> 00:36:11,599
He looked at me with a gleam of amusement, then leaned back, smoke curling upward from his pipe.

00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,500
You are a good chronicler, Watson, though you persist in regarding my small achievements as prodigies.

00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:24,260
Nope. Remember, the world is full of wonders if only one has the eyes to see them.

00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:48,500
.........................

00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:53,199
Baker Street regained its accustomed quiet, my mind continued to dwell upon the singular scenes

00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:57,559
we had lately witnessed. It was one thing to perceive the logical solution of a puzzle.

00:36:57,559 --> 00:37:03,000
It was another to observe the human hearts which beat so anxiously within that puzzle's fring.

00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:07,899
In the days that followed, I noted with interest the manner in which the affair of Lord St. Seep,

00:37:07,899 --> 00:37:12,659
Simon and the Vanished Bride was received by society. As Holmes predicted, the gossip of

00:37:12,659 --> 00:37:17,760
London fastened upon it with greedy tongues. At the clubs, men chuckled behind their hands.

00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:20,260
At afternoon teas, ladies whispered,

00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:24,100
the newspapers, from the morning post to the most sensational evening sheet,

00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,990
printed columns of speculation.

00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:30,470
To word there, a Lord St. Simon, however, bore himself an outward carp.

00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:34,850
A brief statement was issued in his name, couched in terms of dignified restraint.

00:37:34,850 --> 00:37:38,660
Circumstances of a private nature have necessitated the withdrawal of Lady St.

00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:40,460
A simone from public life.

00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,880
No further comment will be made.

00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:44,690
Thus he shielded his wounded pride with the armour of silence.

00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,780
For this, I confess, I felt admiration.

00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:51,610
There was something almost noble in the restraint with which he accepted his humiliation.

00:37:51,610 --> 00:37:54,780
Of Mr. and Mrs. Morden, I heard soon after.

00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:59,210
They had sailed quietly for America, leaving behind them the clamor of tongues.

00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,650
Before their departure, however, a letter was brought to Baker Street,

00:38:02,650 --> 00:38:06,530
which Holmes tossed across to me one evening as we sat by the fire.

00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:09,470
Letter? Read by Watson?

00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:13,360
Dear Mr. Holmes, words cannot tell the gratitude we feel.

00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:19,140
You saved me from dishonour in the eyes of the world and gave me back my husband.

00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:22,670
Be assured that, far from the scenes of my brief misery,

00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:26,860
I shall never forget the friend who stood between me and shame.

00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:33,599
.......

00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,099
With deepest thanks, Harry Moten.

00:38:37,099 --> 00:38:38,760
..

00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,079
I laid the letter down, deeply moved.

00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:43,860
Holmes, this must bring you satisfaction

00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:46,920
Satisfaction of a kind, Watson

00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,619
Though not the sort most men crave

00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:52,630
And what sort do you crave?

00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:56,480
The satisfaction of intellectual clarity

00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:01,340
Observe, this case presented itself as a confusion of appearances

00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:06,079
A nobleman deserted, a bride vanished, rumours of abduction

00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:10,159
Yet beneath lay the simplest of human dramas

00:39:10,159 --> 00:39:17,170
A woman bound by vows, thought broken, returning to the man she truly loved.

00:39:17,170 --> 00:39:22,840
Strip away the ornament, and the skeleton of the fact stands revealed.

00:39:22,840 --> 00:39:27,920
That is the satisfaction, to see clearly where others grope.

00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,679
..

00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:34,960
Yet surely, Holmes, you cannot be insensible to the human element, the anguish of the lady,

00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,899
the wounded pride of Lord Saint Simon.

00:39:36,899 --> 00:39:38,799
O Gamban Bind Simon!

00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:43,060
After a pause, I am not made of marble, Watson

00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:47,880
Yet the detective must school himself to regard emotion as data

00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,700
Not as distraction

00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:54,500
A tear-stained face is but a sign, like a footprint in the clay

00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:59,320
And yet, my dear fellow, sometimes the heart reads more swiftly than the head

00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,420
Which is why, Watson, I keep you by my side

00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:09,360
He smiled, a rare, kindly smile which lit for a moment the austere lines of his face

00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,400
I felt a sudden warmth of pride in my companionship

00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,860
Humble though my share in his achievements might be

00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:20,300
Several days later, as we sat at breakfast, another notice in the papers caught my eye

00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,240
It was an announcement that Lord St. Simon had retired from London for the season

00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,119
Seeking seclusion in the Highlands

00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:27,579
Holmes observed my glance

00:40:27,579 --> 00:40:32,240
A wise retreat, London is merciless in its gossip

00:40:32,239 --> 00:40:35,759
In a month his name would scarcely be mentioned.

00:40:35,759 --> 00:40:37,479
And what of his future homes?

00:40:37,479 --> 00:40:38,909
Shall he marry again?

00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:40,099
Dryly.

00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:42,379
Society has a short memory

00:40:42,379 --> 00:40:45,840
and an ancient title is a powerful magnet.

00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:47,689
He will wed again, no doubt,

00:40:47,689 --> 00:40:50,479
though perhaps he will regard American heiresses

00:40:50,479 --> 00:40:52,819
with a trifle more caution.

00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:55,559
We both laughed quietly at this,

00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:57,959
though my mirth was tempered by sympathy for the man

00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,559
who had lost more than he had gained.

00:40:59,559 --> 00:41:07,500
The case, however, lingered in my thoughts, not for its social scandal, but for the lessons it bore in the method of my friend.

00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:16,809
I resolved, therefore, to question him more closely, for I felt that each problem we encountered was an opportunity for my own instruction in the art of reasoning.

00:41:16,809 --> 00:41:23,970
Holmes, you spoke of the matter as elementary, yet I, who followed every step with anxious eyes, found it anything but simple.

00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:26,779
Will you not explain to me more fully the course of your deductions?

00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:34,780
With pleasure, my dear Watson. Consider first the fact of the note at the church. To the superficial

00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:42,300
mind it is an isolated curiosity. To the analytic mind it is the hinge upon which the whole gaze

00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:50,060
turns. The bride, already pledged, receives a message. Instantly her demeanor changes. What

00:41:50,059 --> 00:41:57,680
message could effect such transformation, one which altered her whole conception of a duty.

00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,519
That could be nothing less than the announcement of a husband alive, alive. But might it not have

00:42:04,519 --> 00:42:11,699
been some warning, some threat? Possible, but not probable. A threat would produce fear,

00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:14,619
Perhaps an appeal for protection

00:42:14,619 --> 00:42:21,519
Instead we observe determination, concealment and later voluntary flight

00:42:21,519 --> 00:42:24,099
The inference is irresistible

00:42:24,099 --> 00:42:27,130
Then the sighting in Hyde Park?

00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,399
Confirmation

00:42:28,399 --> 00:42:32,219
She was seen walking calmly, arm in arm, with a gentleman

00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:34,899
No abduction there, but reunion

00:42:34,899 --> 00:42:37,229
And the maid's testimony?

00:42:37,229 --> 00:42:39,179
Merely the final link

00:42:39,179 --> 00:42:43,920
In truth, I had already reconstructed the story before she spoke a word.

00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,050
Holmes, your confidence amazes me.

00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:49,210
I should have hesitated until every piece was in place.

00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,880
That is the distinction between us, my dear fellow.

00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:57,089
You require the complete puzzle before you perceive the picture.

00:42:57,089 --> 00:43:01,969
I, by contrast, need but a corner and a hue.

00:43:01,969 --> 00:43:05,179
Yet surely that is genius, not method.

00:43:05,179 --> 00:43:10,329
genius, perhaps, is but method carried to its highest oint.

00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:15,000
Because Hurd's words, uttered with quiet conviction, sank deep into my mind,

00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,809
I felt again the gulf between my own laborious reasoning and his swift, intuitive leaps.

00:43:20,809 --> 00:43:23,920
Yet if I could not equal him, I might at least record him,

00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,949
and in so doing render some tribute to the singular powers of my friend.

00:43:27,949 --> 00:43:31,119
As the case of the noble bachelor was brought to an end,

00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:34,779
yet before I close my chronicle, I would share one final scene,

00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:38,300
which lingers in my memory with peculiar vividness.

00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,910
It was a week later, a grey afternoon,

00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:43,270
the fog drifting once more past our windows,

00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:44,910
Holmes sat at his chemical table,

00:43:44,910 --> 00:43:46,140
bending over some experiment

00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:48,480
while I produced a volume of medical essays.

00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:52,180
Suddenly he looked up, his eyes bright with inward fire.

00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:56,220
Watson, do you know why I cherish such cases as this

00:43:56,220 --> 00:43:58,780
above the most sensational of crimes?

00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:01,019
Because they test your powers of deduction?

00:44:01,019 --> 00:44:05,480
Because they reveal the hidden poetry of life.

00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:09,399
Men think me a machine, a calculating engine.

00:44:09,399 --> 00:44:15,090
Yet beneath the dull crust of facts, there lies the drama of human hearts.

00:44:15,090 --> 00:44:21,399
The nobleman proud but lonely, the girl torn between ambition and love,

00:44:21,399 --> 00:44:25,300
the husband thought dead, returned from the grave.

00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:29,699
All these are but figures in a greater tragedy and comedy.

00:44:29,699 --> 00:44:39,569
To discern their secret, to bring light where there is darkness, that is art, Watson, the highest art.

00:44:39,569 --> 00:44:44,710
Then you admit, Holmes, that even the cold logician may feel the throb of romance?

00:44:44,710 --> 00:44:52,219
Smiling faintly, I admit that romance, when properly analysed, is but logic in disguise. How?

00:44:52,219 --> 00:44:58,919
sanctions he bent again to his retorts and i watching him felt that i had dims for an instant

00:44:58,919 --> 00:45:04,500
the hidden depths of that singular nature the keen brain and the lonely heart united in pursuit of

00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:09,719
truth so ended the adventure of the noble bachelor one of many episodes which have revealed to me the

00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:14,919
strange genius of sherlock holmes and the privilege i enjoy in being his companion and chronicler

00:45:14,919 --> 00:45:15,059
.
