00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,150
It has often been my habit, as I have before confessed,

00:00:03,150 --> 00:00:07,379
Ah, Caesar, to record some of the singular adventures of my friend,

00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,169
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective of Baker Street,

00:00:11,169 --> 00:00:14,859
Many of these incidents I have already laid before the public,

00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,250
and yet, the supply seems inexhaustible,

00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:20,679
for scarcely a month passes in which Holmes does not find himself summoned

00:00:20,679 --> 00:00:23,179
to some new case of singular peculiarity,

00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:24,750
at the time of which I now write,

00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:27,120
London was awakening from the cold grip of winter,

00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,880
and the early buds of spring lent the air a fresh vivacity.

00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,140
Our brooms in Baker Street, though humble,

00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,730
were as ever filled with the atmosphere of pipe smoke,

00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:39,280
cappings of newspapers and the restless energies of my companion.

00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,340
It was a morning like many others,

00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,519
with the first light breaking through the curtains

00:00:43,519 --> 00:00:45,969
and Holmes stretched languidly in his armchair,

00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,000
pray, his piercing gaze already fixed on some fresh puzzle.

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,280
For my own part, I had been busying myself with my medical journals,

00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:55,780
though I must admit, my eyes wandered as often to Holmes' keen profile

00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,019
as to the printed page.

00:00:57,019 --> 00:01:16,239
for in every fibre of his being he exuded the restless intellect which made even the most trivial observation a matter of consequence holmes it astonishes me still i remarked laying aside my book how you can spend hours upon end in that chair seemingly idle and yet later reveal that every instant has been applied to deduction

00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:35,000
idle my dear watson no no a man might appear at rest but within his faculties may be in as active a play as the wheels of a well-oiled mechanism you see me seated here yet i have traversed half of england in my mind since breathless

00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,719
Then I should count myself fortunate, if you will, for my own instruction.

00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,620
Share with me some fragment of these mental journeys.

00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:44,239
Elementary Watson, observe.

00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:45,299
..

00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:49,460
Holmes leaned forward, his eyes shining with sudden energy.

00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:56,599
The gentleman who passed our window a quarter hour ago, tall, with the gait of a soldier.

00:01:56,599 --> 00:02:02,299
You remarked him not, and yet, I may tell you he has lately returned from Afghanistan,

00:02:02,299 --> 00:02:04,759
is much troubled by his finances

00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,300
and bears the weight of a domestic quarrel upon his conscience.

00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,460
..

00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,829
Upon my word, Holmes, I cried,

00:02:12,829 --> 00:02:14,930
half in protest, half in admiration.

00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:17,859
You cannot expect me to accept such sweeping confusions

00:02:17,859 --> 00:02:19,719
without some explanation.

00:02:19,719 --> 00:02:24,149
On the contrary, I expect you always to demand explanation,

00:02:24,149 --> 00:02:27,649
for therein lies the training of the mind,

00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:30,219
the upright carriage, the shortened step,

00:02:30,219 --> 00:02:33,569
and the tan line about his eyes bespoke,

00:02:33,569 --> 00:02:35,719
the soldier returned from the east.

00:02:35,719 --> 00:02:37,199
..

00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:39,420
His boots, though of fine leather,

00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:41,980
were much cracked and ill-blacked,

00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,900
suggesting diminished means.

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:45,319
..

00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:47,919
Finally, the ink smudge upon his cuff

00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:49,879
was no ordinary accident.

00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,079
It bore the clear mark of hurried correspondence,

00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:57,560
most likely letters of reconciliation or recrimination.

00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:00,219
...

00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:04,189
It is all quite elementary, my dear fellow.

00:03:04,189 --> 00:03:09,550
I could not but smile at his complacency, though my admiration for his craft never waned.

00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:14,180
Such was the very air of Baker Street, a mixture of the ordinary and the extraordinary,

00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:18,259
the commonplace transmuted into gold by Holmes' peculiar genius.

00:03:18,259 --> 00:03:23,189
It was upon this morning, while Holmes still discoursed upon the habits of returning soldiers,

00:03:23,189 --> 00:03:26,620
that Mrs. Biss's Hudson entered with a card upon a tree.

00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,639
A young lady has called, gentlemen, said our landlady.

00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:34,840
A boy stinged with that deference she always reserved for Holmes' visitors.

00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,750
She begs an audience if you can spare the time.

00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,060
Show her in at once, Mrs. Hudson, said Holmes briskly.

00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,620
Watson, here is a chance for you to apply that good, honest, medical eye of yours.

00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,860
..

00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:55,180
We shall see what manner of visitor London bestows upon us this morning.

00:03:55,180 --> 00:04:00,050
With that, the door opened, and there entered a young lady of striking appearance,

00:04:00,050 --> 00:04:02,259
though her attire bore signs of modest means.

00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,960
Her figure was tall and graceful, her hair of a rich chestnut hue,

00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,000
and her expression one of mingled anxiety and determination.

00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,310
She carried herself with the dignity of one who has resolved upon a difficult course,

00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:15,900
though her eyes betrayed a certain apprehension.

00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:21,379
Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, she began, her voice low but steady.

00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,519
I thank you for receiving me.

00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:28,879
My name is Violet Hunter, and I am by profession a governess.

00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:29,899
..

00:04:29,899 --> 00:04:36,339
Pray be seated, Miss Hunter, Holmes replied, motioning her toward the chair opposite him.

00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:40,990
You will oblige us by stating the facts which bring you here.

00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:45,149
As she seated herself, I could not help but note the pallor of her cheeks,

00:04:45,149 --> 00:04:48,809
the slight tremor of her hands, and the eager glance she directed at Holmes,

00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:51,599
as though upon his wisdom rested her entire future.

00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,910
It may seem to you, gentlemen, a trifling matter, she said, clasping her gloved hands together,

00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:05,360
but to me it is of the deepest consequence. I have been offered a position, an exceedingly

00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,560
generous one, far above the usual terms for a governess, and yet the conditions attached to

00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:16,879
it are so unusual, so disquieting, that I know not whether I dare accept without your counsel.

00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:28,990
Indeed, Holmes murmured, his eyes narrowing with interest, an unusual offer, generous remuneration, but conditions that awaken suspicion.

00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:33,000
Yes, Watson, you perceive the outline of a problem here already.

00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,240
Pray continue, Miss Hunter, and omit no detail, however trivial it may appear to you.

00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,699
Thus encouraged, the young lady began to relate her circumstances,

00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:48,340
her words, pouring forth in a mixture of relief and nervous urgency.

00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,540
I have for some years supported myself as a governess,

00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:57,240
though the wages have seldom sufficed for more than the barest necessities.

00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,329
Recently, through an agency, I was introduced to a gentleman of singular appearance and manner,

00:06:03,329 --> 00:06:06,480
one Mr. Geoffrey Rewcastle,

00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:11,570
who resides in the country at a place called the Copper Beaches near Winchester.

00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:16,970
Mr. Hmm, Rue Castle offered me a salary of 100 pounds a year,

00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,769
double my present earnings with the charge of his young child.

00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:25,960
The sum dazzled me and yet the conditions he attached were so extraordinary

00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,860
that I confess I hesitated.

00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:31,860
Extraordinary conditions I repeated? In what way?

00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:50,639
Mr. Hmm, Rue Castle, while most affable, insisted upon certain requirements that I should, for instance, wear a particular dress of blue silk whenever requested, cut my hair short at his wise desire, and sit each evening in the drawing-room window in such a manner that I might be seen from the road.

00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:59,279
When I protested at the strangeness of these demands, he laughed and assured me it was but a harmless whim, yet his manner left me uneasy.

00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:05,579
He urged me, moreover, to decide at once and hinted that refusal would be most unwise.

00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:06,620
..

00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,680
As she spoke, Holmes leaned back, steepling his fingers and closing his eyes, the very image of concentrated thought.

00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:21,120
Most singular indeed! You are wise to hesitate, Miss Hunter. When an employer offers double wages

00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,939
for a simple post, one must suspect that the duties are far from ordinary. Tell me,

00:07:26,939 --> 00:07:31,440
what impression did you form of this Mr. Rucastle himself?

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:37,019
He is a stout man, ruddy of face, with a hearty manner that struck me as somewhat forced,

00:07:37,019 --> 00:07:40,459
was though beneath his juviality lay another nature.

00:07:40,459 --> 00:07:43,419
His wife, pale and silent, seemed oppressed

00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:46,159
and scarcely raised her eyes throughout the interview.

00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:48,199
They have, too, a son,

00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,779
grown yet of a surly and disagreeable aspect,

00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,259
though he did not speak to me.

00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:53,519
..

00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,479
And yet, with all these misgivings,

00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,240
you are tempted by the salary?

00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,409
Indeed, doctor, I am.

00:07:59,409 --> 00:08:03,269
A woman must live, and such an offer comes but rarely.

00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:05,919
Still, I could not shake the sense

00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:13,120
that to accept blindly might plunge me into peril. Thus I resolved to seek Mr. Holmes's advice

00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:20,759
before I gave my answer. You did wisely, Miss Hunter, Holmes declared, opening his eyes and

00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,379
fixing her with a keen glance. There is, I suspect, more behind these copper beaches than meets the

00:08:27,379 --> 00:08:33,920
eye. We shall not pronounce judgment astily. You will place before me every particular,

00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:42,259
the house, the family, the conditions, and then, if you consent, Watson and I shall accompany you to Hampshire.

00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:43,979
..

00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:52,019
In such cases, the devil lurks in details, and we must first acquaint ourselves with every stone of the ground.

00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:56,730
Miss Hunter's countenance brightened at his words, as though a great burden were lifted.

00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:02,459
I could see in Holmes' bearing that the matter, far from being trivial, had already engaged his full attention.

00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:08,240
Then you will aid me, Mr. Holmes, she asked, her voice trembling with gratitude.

00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:15,519
Most assuredly. You have placed your trust in me, and I shall not see you deceived or endangered

00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:21,470
if it can be prevented. Leave the acceptance of the post in abeyance for a day or two,

00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:27,759
and meanwhile I will make such inquiries as may be needful. Rest assured, Miss Hunter,

00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:32,359
that whatever sinister element lies behind these copper beeches,

00:09:32,359 --> 00:09:34,039
we shall bring it to light.

00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:36,980
...

00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,809
With these assurances, the young lady took her leave,

00:09:39,809 --> 00:09:41,480
a step lighter than when she came.

00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,859
For my own part, I watched Holmes with curiosity,

00:09:43,859 --> 00:09:45,840
for I knew the gleam in his eye too well.

00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:48,779
The gain, as he was wont to say, was afoot.

00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,200
Holmes, I said, when the door had closed,

00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,100
do you truly think there is danger for the young lady?

00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,899
Danger, Watson, most assuredly.

00:09:56,899 --> 00:10:01,180
where money is lavishly offered and conditions are eccentric,

00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,159
one may be certain that some hidden motive underlies the mask.

00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:09,259
The dress, the haircut, the posture at the window,

00:10:09,259 --> 00:10:12,339
these are no whims but parts of a scheme.

00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,079
We must discover what lies at the root,

00:10:15,079 --> 00:10:20,049
lest Miss Hunter fall into a trap more subtle than she dreams.

00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:25,819
As he spoke, Holmes' features were animated with that singular energy

00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:29,009
which always possessed him when confronted by a mystery.

00:10:29,009 --> 00:10:34,180
For my own part, I confess my imagination was already stirred by the prospect, the name itself.

00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:37,100
Copper beaches seemed to carry a note of foreboding,

00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,360
as though the very trees concealed some secret.

00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,670
Thus began an adventure, which was to test our vigilance and reveal,

00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,080
beneath the tranquil surface of an English country house,

00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,440
passions as dark as any in London's fog-bound alleys.

00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:51,900
A day or two elapsed after the visit of Miss Violet Hunter,

00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:54,180
during which Holmes was uncommonly restless.

00:10:54,179 --> 00:11:01,569
He paced our sitting room like a caged hound, ordinately smoking pipe after pipe and scanning the morning papers with apparent indifference.

00:11:01,569 --> 00:11:09,240
Yet I, who knew him so well, could see that his whole mind was absorbed by the singular conditions of the Copper Beaches engagement.

00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:18,339
His manner, more than once, reminded me of those occasions when a criminal at large still eluded him, and he scented the chaise but had not yet sighted his quarry.

00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:24,079
Holmes, I said one evening, as the firelight gild upon the litter table, you appear consumed by impatience.

00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,899
Has there been any fresh word from Miss Hunter?

00:11:25,899 --> 00:11:27,279
..

00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,659
Indeed there has, Holmes replied,

00:11:30,659 --> 00:11:34,629
springing to his feet and fetching a letter from the mantelpiece.

00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:38,659
She has accepted the post at Copper Beaches, as I bade her do.

00:11:38,659 --> 00:11:44,139
She leaves for Hampshire tomorrow, but she implores us to accompany her.

00:11:44,139 --> 00:11:49,779
The urgency of her request confirms what my reason had already indicated,

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:55,360
that beneath the fair-seeming exterior of Mr. Yerrier,

00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,980
..

00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:01,730
Jeff Rucastle lies something both sinister and dangerous.

00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,419
You allow me, Holmes, I said.

00:12:04,419 --> 00:12:06,710
Do you think her very safety is at stake?

00:12:06,710 --> 00:12:10,710
My dear fellow, Holmes replied gravely,

00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:15,620
the safety of a lone young woman in a secluded country house

00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:18,699
under the sway of a man of dubious character

00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:22,509
must always be a matter of concern.

00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:28,410
Remember, Watson, crime does not confine itself to the dark alleys of London.

00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:33,269
It lurks as often beneath the red-tiled roofs of rustic homesteads.

00:12:33,269 --> 00:12:35,529
You will accompany me.

00:12:35,529 --> 00:12:40,400
With pleasure, I exclaimed, my heart already stirred by the prospect of adventure.

00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,630
And thus it was, on a bright spring morning,

00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,700
being Andy, that Holmes and I found ourselves upon the train to Winchester.

00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:52,420
The journey was a pleasant one, with the green fields rolling past, dotted with grazing sheep,

00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,279
and the hedgerows alive, with the first notes of birdsong.

00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,450
Ones, however, paid little heed to the scenery.

00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:02,540
He sat opposite me, his eyes half-closed, his long, thin fingers drumming upon his knee

00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:04,770
in rhythm with the clatter of the weaves.

00:13:04,770 --> 00:13:09,890
You are forming theories already, I ventured, breaking the silence.

00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,250
Theories, Watson, no, mere surmises.

00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:16,540
We must not permit imagination to outrun the facts.

00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:23,959
1. Yet certain elements are suggestive. Consider the insistence upon the young lady cutting her

00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:30,439
hair, the peculiar demand that she sit visible at the window, the lavish salary, each points to some

00:13:30,439 --> 00:13:40,039
deception, some masquerade. The lady is to serve not as herself, but as another. For whose benefit

00:13:40,039 --> 00:13:42,349
and for what purpose?

00:13:42,349 --> 00:13:44,609
That is the question.

00:13:44,609 --> 00:13:47,519
You think then she is being made to impersonate someone?

00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:48,599
..

00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:49,459
Precisely.

00:13:49,459 --> 00:13:52,119
But whether the design is to lure,

00:13:52,119 --> 00:13:54,319
to deceive or to conceal,

00:13:54,319 --> 00:13:56,210
we have yet to learn.

00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:58,379
The country air will perhaps give us

00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,700
clearer heads than London fog.

00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,699
At Winchester we alighted

00:14:02,699 --> 00:14:05,000
and there we were met by Miss Hunter herself.

00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,700
She looked paler than when we had seen her in Baker Street,

00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,909
though her countenance brightened at sight of Holmes.

00:14:09,909 --> 00:14:16,490
"'Oh, Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson!' she cried, taking our hands with evident relief.

00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:19,659
"'I cannot tell you what it means to have your support.

00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:23,539
Already the situation grows more singular than I had imagined.'

00:14:23,539 --> 00:14:28,049
"'Compose yourself, Miss Hunter,' said Holmes gently.

00:14:28,049 --> 00:14:35,439
"'Holmes, we are here now, and you have but to describe what has occurred since you entered upon your post.'

00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,220
I scarcely know where to begin. The house is large and lonely, surrounded by gloomy copper

00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,810
beaches which give it its name. Mr. Rucastle received me with the same forced heartiness,

00:14:48,810 --> 00:14:55,820
why his wife seemed more worn and spiritless than ever. But it is their demands, Mr. Holmes.

00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,880
They insisted immediately that I cut my hair, which I did most unwillingly. Then, each evening,

00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:08,990
they compel me to wear that blue dress and to sit in the great front window for an hour,

00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:12,860
though I am forbidden to draw the blinds or stir from the chair.

00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:16,320
I feel like a doll set upon display for unseen eyes.

00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,500
..

00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,059
Holmes's face grew intent as he listened,

00:15:20,059 --> 00:15:25,129
his eyes gleaming with that inward fire which lit them when a problem seized him.

00:15:25,129 --> 00:15:28,059
Yes, Watson, it is as I supposed.

00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:34,439
She is compelled to impersonate, but the object of this performance must yet be ascertained.

00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:39,559
Miss Hunter, have you observed anything of note during these enforced exhibitions?

00:15:39,559 --> 00:15:42,919
....

00:15:42,919 --> 00:15:50,859
Nothing certain, sir. Yet twice I fancied I saw a man standing among the trees at the far end of

00:15:50,859 --> 00:15:55,779
the drive, gazing toward the house. When I would have mentioned it, Mr. Ha!

00:15:55,779 --> 00:16:01,720
"'Ah!' Ruecastle laughed boisterously and bade me not let idle fancies trouble my mind.

00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,460
"'And you are permitted free range of the house otherwise?' I asked.

00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:11,620
"'Oh, no, doctor. Many of the rooms are locked, and when once I stray toward a wing at the back—'

00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:18,019
"'Mr.—' Ruecastle's manner altered frightfully. He seized my arm, his eyes flashing with anger,

00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:23,360
and commanded me never to set foot there again. His cheerfulness returned the next instant,

00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:27,440
but the memory of his face in that moment chills me still.

00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,329
Most interesting, murmured Holmes.

00:16:30,329 --> 00:16:35,330
And this locked wing, does any sound ever proceed from it?

00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:36,120
Knock!

00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:37,279
..

00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,789
Hmm, why yes, hmm.

00:16:39,789 --> 00:16:43,000
At night, when all is quiet, I have heard faint footsteps

00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,950
and once a sob stifled as though from fear.

00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:50,420
I dared not speak of it, but I am certain I did not dream.

00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:54,449
Holmes rose from the bench whereon we had seated ourselves near the station.

00:16:54,449 --> 00:16:58,599
His tall figure seemed to tower, his features sharp with decision.

00:16:58,599 --> 00:17:03,519
Watson, the case declares itself more plainly with each word.

00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:10,679
There is a secret prisoner in that house whose likeness Miss Hunter is compelled to imitate.

00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:17,680
The sobs, the surveillance, the enforced impersonation all point to it.

00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:22,200
The task before us is to unmask the Rue Castle's design

00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:27,900
and to set at liberty whoever languishes behind those barred doors.

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,380
But Holmes, surely we cannot proceed without more certain evidence

00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:35,849
to intrude upon a man's house on suspicion alone.

00:17:35,849 --> 00:17:40,529
My dear fellow, justice cannot always wait upon ceremony,

00:17:40,529 --> 00:17:42,670
yet we must be cautious.

00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,940
Tonight, Miss Hunter, you will observe closely

00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:52,030
any further sign of watchers outside the window. Watson and I shall lodge at a nearby inn,

00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:57,430
and to-morrow, with your guidance, we shall take a nearer view of this copper beaches.

00:17:57,430 --> 00:18:04,440
If our suspicions prove just, then, believe me, the law will find ample cause to enter.

00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:11,480
Oh, thank heaven I sought your help, cried Miss Hunter, clasping her hands. I feel now that

00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:16,010
Whatever evil lurks at the copper beaches, I shall not face it alone.

00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,840
And so it was arranged.

00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,000
That evening Holmes and I took rooms at a modest inn upon the outskirts of Winchester

00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,490
while Miss Hunter returned to the great shadowed house among the beaches.

00:18:25,490 --> 00:18:28,019
I recall vividly the sight of her figure,

00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:30,570
slight yet resolute, as she passed down the lane,

00:18:30,570 --> 00:18:33,990
the copper-hued branches swaying overhead like watchful sentinels.

00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,860
Holmes sat long that night by the inn's window,

00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,599
his profile etched against the lamplight and creak arm,

00:18:39,599 --> 00:18:42,940
His gaze fixed upon the dark outline of the distant trees.

00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:46,029
He spoke little, but once he turned to me and said,

00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:46,359
Oh!

00:18:46,359 --> 00:18:47,379
..

00:18:47,379 --> 00:18:51,909
There is a drama enacting itself behind those walls, Watson.

00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:55,900
Darker, perhaps, than even Miss Hunter dreams.

00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,490
Mark me before this matter is resolved.

00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:06,089
We shall stand face to face with both cruelty and cunning of the most refined order.

00:19:06,089 --> 00:19:09,019
Ah! His words struck a chill into my heart,

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,670
though the April night was mild,

00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,110
for I knew too well that when Holmes spoke thus,

00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:14,559
he did not speak lightly.

00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,250
Somewhere within the copper beaches,

00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:18,679
a hidden soul cried out for deliverance,

00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:22,170
and we by strange chance had been summoned to answer.

00:19:22,170 --> 00:19:25,440
The following morning dawned grey and cool,

00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,380
with a thin mist rising from the fields about Winchester.

00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,559
Holmes, ever the early riser when a case pressed upon his mind,

00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,909
was already at the inn's window when I awoke,

00:19:33,909 --> 00:19:36,859
his gaze fixed steadily upon the distant line of copper beaches

00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:38,840
that loomed against the pale sky.

00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:39,949
Abiel!

00:19:39,949 --> 00:19:44,699
You have not stepped much, Holmes, I remarked, rising and drawing the curtains wider.

00:19:44,699 --> 00:19:48,450
Why, nor could I, Watson, he replied calmly.

00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:55,430
A man does not lie easily abed when there is a human creature imprisoned yonder within those walls.

00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,730
Today we must go nearer, though with discretion.

00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:02,960
Our object is to obtain knowledge, not yet to act.

00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,519
After breakfast, we set forth along the country road that led toward the Copper Beaches.

00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:12,900
It was a curious name, but the grove itself justified it amply, for the glade trees grew

00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:17,159
in solemn ranks about the house, their foliage tinged with a ruddy bronze even in spring.

00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:22,820
The mansion rose behind them, large, solid, with high gables and long rows of windows,

00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:24,429
many of which were shuttered.

00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:29,059
A high stone wall enclosed the grounds, and the great iron gate, at which we presently

00:20:29,059 --> 00:20:32,440
paused, was flanked by lodges, now falling into disrepair.

00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,389
A gloomy, forbidding place, I muttered, gazing up at the silent façade.

00:20:37,389 --> 00:20:52,019
yes watson a prison wearing the mask of a country home observe how the shutters of that upper wing are secured from without that is not to exclude the light but to prevent escape

00:20:52,019 --> 00:21:07,139
as we stood thus the gate creaked and out came miss violet hunter who had contrived to meet us upon the road under pretext of an errand she carried herself with a composure born of necessity but her face was pale and i noted the anxious way in which she glanced back at the house

00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:24,320
mr holmes dr watson she whispered i cannot remain long for mr walking on on rucastle is most jealous of my movements but i begged leave to fetch some trifling things from the village and so slipped out to meet you i have fresh tidings

00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:35,140
be quickly then miss hunter said holmes his keen eyes softening with sympathy every detail is of value

00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:51,640
last night when i sat in the window as ordered i again perceived a figure among the trees this time i am certain it was a man tall and gaunt with features too far to distinguish he raised his hands toward me in subducation but before i could respond mr

00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,840
Rucastle burst into the room laughing loudly and clapping me upon the shoulder.

00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:02,280
He cried that I made a picture fit to grace any gallery, and insisted I hold my posture

00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,920
until the hour was done.

00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:08,820
Oh, Mr. Holmes, the whole business fills me with dread.

00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:11,220
It is monstrous!

00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,440
I exclaimed.

00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:15,759
You are made a lure for some unhappy watcher outside.

00:22:15,759 --> 00:22:18,380
Patience, Watson, said Holmes.

00:22:18,380 --> 00:22:20,259
We are close to the truth.

00:22:20,259 --> 00:22:25,250
Miss Hunter, you must endure a little longer, though I know the strain is severe.

00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:30,039
Tonight Watson and I shall conceal ourselves in the grove.

00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:35,199
If this mysterious watcher appears again, we shall have our answer.

00:22:35,199 --> 00:22:40,039
I will do as you advise, sir, she said bravely, but there is more.

00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:46,039
Yesterday, by chance, I saw Mrs. Rucastle in tears, wringing her hands as though in despair.

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:55,589
When she perceived me, she fled without a word, and later I heard Mr. Rukasso scolding her in harsh tones, though I could not catch the words.

00:22:55,589 --> 00:23:00,960
A family drama of coercion and cruelty, Holmes murmured.

00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,399
Amels murmured.

00:23:02,399 --> 00:23:07,399
Watson, mark my words, this pale woman is no accomplice, but a sufferer herself.

00:23:07,399 --> 00:23:08,839
..

00:23:08,839 --> 00:23:11,880
We must not judge her harshly.

00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,539
At that moment, the very man of whom we spoke appeared.

00:23:15,539 --> 00:23:20,849
Mr. Rinkra, Mr. Loeb, if Rukhasa himself came striding down the drive toward the gate, go.

00:23:20,849 --> 00:23:26,369
He was a stout man, flouted of countenance, with a jovial air that sat uneasily upon him,

00:23:26,369 --> 00:23:29,759
as though he wore it like a mask ill-fitted to the features beneath.

00:23:29,759 --> 00:23:33,789
Ah, Miss Hunter, he cried, his voice hearty. Off to the village, are you?

00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:37,990
And friends, to bid you farewell on your walk. Well, well, introductions then, Mr.

00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:44,159
Holmes, my companion said, smoothly bowing. Sherlock Holmes, at your service.

00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,240
and my friend, Dr. Watson.

00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,460
..

00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,920
We are in the district for a few days

00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:54,120
and had the good fortune to encounter Miss Hunter,

00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,900
whom we knew in London.

00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,019
..

00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,980
Indeed, delighted gentleman, delighted Boondry Castle,

00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,559
his ruddy face creasing into a grin.

00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:03,099
London at acquaintances, eh?

00:24:03,099 --> 00:24:07,320
Well, Miss Hunter is brewing herself a pearl among governesses, I assure you.

00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,010
Come, come, you must join us for refreshment.

00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:12,980
Copper Beaches is no hermitage, though we are a quiet household.

00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:14,120
Pray, walk in.

00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:20,400
He flung the gate wide with a flourish and ushered us up the drive with an insistence that brooked an

00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,460
or refusal.

00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:25,500
Holmes, to my surprise, acquiesced readily,

00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:30,900
though I saw in the quick gleam of his eye that he welcomed the chance to inspect the house at close quarters.

00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,880
The entrance hall was lofty and sombre, lined with dark panelling,

00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:39,160
and hung here and there with portraits whose subjects scowled doomily from their frames.

00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,230
Lucasa led us into a great drawing room,

00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:44,070
furnished richly but with a heaviness that oppressed the spirits,

00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,970
Hmm, Mrs. Hmm.

00:24:45,970 --> 00:24:51,360
Vukasil was there, a pale, delicate woman with downcast eyes who rose nervously at our approach.

00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,820
She greeted us with courtesy, but her manner was so timid that I pitied her at once.

00:24:55,820 --> 00:25:00,150
My dear, these are friends of Miss Hunter's, Vukasil announced, rubbing his hands together.

00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:02,890
Mr. Holmes and Dr. Watson from London.

00:25:02,890 --> 00:25:05,800
They will take a glass of wine with us before continuing their ramble.

00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:10,920
You are welcome, gentlemen, she murmured, barely lifting her eyes.

00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:17,950
You have a charming home, madam, Holmes observed politely,

00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:26,000
his gaze meanwhile sweeping the room with that rapid, comprehensive glance of his which missed no detail.

00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,639
I saw his eyes linger upon the long French window which gale upon the front lawn,

00:25:30,639 --> 00:25:33,829
the very spot where Miss Hunter had been compelled to sit.

00:25:33,829 --> 00:25:38,779
The curtain was drawn back now, and one could see across the drive to the distant fringe of trees.

00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:44,819
Yes, yes, a fine old place, cried Rukasal. Copperbeaches has been in my family for generations.

00:25:44,819 --> 00:25:50,630
Solid as the oak that girded hay. And Miss Hunter, well, she has brought new life to our nursery, has she not, my dear?

00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,299
Yes, she whispered faintly.

00:25:53,299 --> 00:25:57,829
I thought Holmes' face grew sterner as he watched the poor lady's trembling hands.

00:25:57,829 --> 00:26:03,399
But he said nothing, sipping his wine in silence while Rukasal discoursed boisterously upon country matters.

00:26:03,399 --> 00:26:08,490
Good. At length, our host excused himself to attend to some business, and we rose to depart.

00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:12,389
What's them? Holmes whispered as we passed into the hall.

00:26:12,389 --> 00:26:18,429
Note the heavy boats upon that side door and the splashes upon the threshold.

00:26:18,429 --> 00:26:22,389
Something is kept or confined there.

00:26:22,389 --> 00:26:24,509
I nodded, my heart quickening.

00:26:24,509 --> 00:26:29,460
Even in that brief passage, the whole house had seemed to exude secrecy and restraint.

00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:31,839
...

00:26:31,839 --> 00:26:36,160
Take care, gentlemen, Miss Hunter whispered as she escorted us to the gate.

00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,300
Rue Castle grows suspicious easily

00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:42,480
Tonight, tonight you will be in the grove

00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,080
Without fail, said Holmes firmly

00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,440
Courage, Miss Hunter

00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,600
The end is nearer than you think

00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,600
Thus we took our leave

00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,660
And the heavy gate clanged behind us

00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,460
With a note that sounded to my ears

00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,160
Like the closing of a prison door

00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:00,700
As we walked back toward the inn

00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,160
Holmes was silent for a while

00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,440
His brows drawn in thought

00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,940
At last he spoke

00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:11,880
The mask slips, Watson, but a little more and the whole visage will be revealed.

00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,090
We have seen enough to know that treachery is here and cruelty besides.

00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:21,279
Tonight shall decide the matter.

00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,700
If fortune favours us before another day dawns,

00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:28,960
the secret of the copper beaches will stand bare to the light of justice.

00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,440
...

00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,480
His words sent a shiver through me.

00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:37,030
Though the sun had now broken forth and gilded the fields with light,

00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:39,860
the quiet countryside seemed a strange setting for dark intrigue.

00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:42,300
Yet I knew too well, from past adventures,

00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:47,230
that crime and passion lurked as often beneath peaceful roofs as in the heart of the great city.

00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:49,150
And so we returned to our inn,

00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:53,220
our hearts resolved for the vigil that awaited us beneath the copper-hued trees.

00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,199
That night was one I shall not easily forget, a plinge being said.

00:27:57,199 --> 00:27:58,960
The April air was cool but still,

00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,360
and a pale moon hung over the Hampshire fields,

00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,710
casting long shadows of the trees across the lane.

00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,539
Holmes and I had supped early at the inn

00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:07,240
and as the hour of nine approached,

00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,039
we set out toward the copper beaches,

00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,340
our footsteps muffled on the soft road.

00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,140
Holmes carried his stout ash stick

00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:16,039
while I had armed myself with my old service revolver

00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:17,550
at his suggestion.

00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:19,539
We go as watchers,

00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:21,900
not as aggressors, Watson,

00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,529
Holmes said as we strode along.

00:28:24,529 --> 00:28:26,680
But it is well to be prepared

00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:31,019
for a cornered villain may strike like a rat in a trap.

00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:32,600
..

00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,840
We leached the grove of copper beeches

00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,619
whose great branches stretched overhead like the arches of a cathedral.

00:28:38,619 --> 00:28:39,920
Concealed among their trunks,

00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:42,610
we had a clear view of the front windows of the house.

00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:44,259
Already the lamps were lit within

00:28:44,259 --> 00:28:47,650
and in the great drawing room window we saw a figure seated,

00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:50,260
Miss Violet Hunter, clad in the blue dress,

00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,539
her cropped hair gleaming in the lamplight.

00:28:52,539 --> 00:28:56,289
To a girl, I muttered, she sits like a prisoner on display.

00:28:56,289 --> 00:29:16,759
yes watson and yet mark well she is not herself but another observe the silhouette the posture clearly contrived to resemble some absent figure the deception is meant for eyes such as ours or rather for that solitary watcher we expect

00:29:16,759 --> 00:29:21,420
Even as he spoke, a movement stirred at the far edge of the lawn. Among the shadows of the trees,

00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:26,860
a tall form emerged, a man, gaunt and haggard, who gazed with desperate intensity toward the window.

00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:31,489
He stretched out his hands as if in entreaty. My heart leapt, for the truth flashed upon me.

00:29:31,489 --> 00:29:34,480
Here was the one whom Miss Hunter had been made to represent.

00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:40,970
Holmes, there is our answer, I whispered. Hush, Watson. Let us observe a moment longer.

00:29:40,970 --> 00:29:45,559
The man took a step forward, then halted suddenly as the front door of the house opened.

00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:47,500
covered Khatil lantern in hand.

00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,699
His broad form outlined against the light.

00:29:49,699 --> 00:29:53,380
He strode across the lawn with surprising agility for one of his bulk,

00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:55,389
his eyes darting to left and right.

00:29:55,389 --> 00:29:58,619
At the same instant, a figure among the trees melted back into the shadows

00:29:58,619 --> 00:30:00,230
and was lost to sight.

00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,989
Who's there? he bellowed, his voice echoing harshly in the still night.

00:30:03,989 --> 00:30:05,469
Come out, you rogue!

00:30:05,469 --> 00:30:07,649
Show yourself or I'll set the dog on you.

00:30:07,649 --> 00:30:11,309
To say, he raised the lantern high, but no answer came.

00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:14,069
With an oath, he turned and strode back toward the house,

00:30:14,069 --> 00:30:15,429
slamming the door behind him.

00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:20,720
The man outside is the key, I whispered. But who is he, and why is he denied entrance?

00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,690
We shall know soon enough. Tonight we must go further, Watson. Come.

00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:31,940
To my astonishment, Holmes crept from our hiding place and stole across the lawn with the noiseless

00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:36,840
tread of a cat. Followed, my heart pounding, and together we reached the shadow of the house.

00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,399
Holmes moved unerringly toward a side door, upon which I had earlier observed heavy balls.

00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:46,140
He bent low, examining the threshold with his lantern shielded by his hand.

00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,269
As I thought, he murmured, see these scratches, Watson, made by claws.

00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:57,430
A dog has been chained here, one of size and ferocity I should judge.

00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,810
We must proceed with caution.

00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:02,349
Bree skirted the building, hugging the wall,

00:31:02,349 --> 00:31:05,410
until we came to a small window partly concealed by ivy.

00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:08,340
Holmes pressed his face close, then motioned me to look.

00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:13,720
Within was a narrow passage, and at the end of it, a stout door, its panels reinforced with iron.

00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:14,819
..

00:31:14,819 --> 00:31:20,009
The prison chamber, he whispered, and mark the light beneath the door. Someone is within.

00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:22,599
Then we must force it, I breathed.

00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,019
Hey, music me.

00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:27,809
Not yet. Let us first try the simple means.

00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:34,079
He produced from his pocket a small set of keys, those slender implements of steel which he had shown, he goised in.

00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:35,960
We more than once in our adventures

00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,019
Keep alas!

00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,179
With deft fingers he tried one after another

00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,699
Until with a faint lick the window yielded

00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,720
In another moment we were inside the passage

00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:45,579
The musty air glows about us

00:31:45,579 --> 00:31:47,159
We crept to the iron-bound door

00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:49,179
And Holmes placed his ear against it

00:31:49,179 --> 00:31:52,449
Listen, Watson, do you hear?

00:31:52,449 --> 00:31:54,039
I held my breath

00:31:54,039 --> 00:31:57,079
And indeed I caught a faint sound like the sobbing of a woman

00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:58,099
Stifled and low

00:31:58,099 --> 00:31:59,339
My blood ran cold

00:31:59,339 --> 00:32:02,159
We cannot delay, Holmes said firmly

00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:04,340
Stand ready, revolver in hand

00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,300
He tried the handle

00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,360
It was locked

00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:09,480
Then, without further ceremony

00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:11,019
He set his shoulder to the panel

00:32:11,019 --> 00:32:13,060
And pressed with all his wily strength

00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:14,519
The wood cleat but held

00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:16,240
Again he flung himself upon it

00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,340
And this time the lock burst with a snap

00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,680
The door swung inward

00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,300
And we rushed into the chamber

00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,519
It was a small, bare room

00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:24,980
Lit by a single lamp

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,920
On a bed in the corner sat a young woman

00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,160
Her face hidden in her hands

00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,000
Her hair of chestnut hue cut short as though by force

00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,599
She looked up with a cry as we entered, and I started in astonishment,

00:32:34,599 --> 00:32:37,759
for she was the very image of Miss Violet Hunter.

00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:43,819
Who are you? Oh, for pity's sake, do not harm me, she cried.

00:32:43,819 --> 00:32:44,900
..

00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,829
Fear nothing, madam, said Holmes gently.

00:32:47,829 --> 00:32:51,819
We are friends. Tell me, are you Miss Alice Screwcastle?

00:32:51,819 --> 00:32:53,019
..

00:32:53,019 --> 00:32:56,180
Yes, yes, I am, she sobbed.

00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,730
But my father, he will kill me if he finds you here.

00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:06,000
Good ease! Before Holmes could reply, there came a furious shout from the passage, and

00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:10,599
the thud of heavy feet, door was flung wide, and Geoffrey Rucastle burst in, his face purple

00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,599
with rage.

00:33:11,599 --> 00:33:17,700
You scoundrels! he roared. Thieves! Intruders in my house! By heaven, I'll make you pay!

00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:22,000
He raised a heavy stick, but Holmes stepped calmly between him and the cowering girl.

00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,539
Enough, Rucastle, he said coldly. Your villainy is exposed. We know that you kept your daughter

00:33:29,539 --> 00:33:36,450
a prisoner here, while forcing another to impersonate her. The law shall deal with you.

00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:41,569
Lies, malicious lies, he bellowed. She is mad, I tell you, mad as a march hare.

00:33:41,569 --> 00:33:43,659
I keep her here for her own safety.

00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:52,119
Mad? And yet so precisely does she resemble your governess that you must clip her hair

00:33:52,119 --> 00:33:58,980
and compel another to play her part at the window? No, sir, the only madness here is your

00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:05,900
own cruelty. Stand aside, or by heaven you shall find the odds against you. At that instant there

00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:11,900
came a deep growl from without, and through the broken door burst a huge hound, its eyes gleaming,

00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,559
its fangs bared. It hurled itself at Holmes, but with a spring he avoided the rush. I fired my

00:34:17,559 --> 00:34:22,650
revolver, the report echoing through the house, and the beast fell with a snarl at our feet.

00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:28,760
My dog! My beautiful Carlo! cried Rucastle in frenzy, dropping his stick and kneeling

00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:35,130
beside the animal. You've murdered him. Better the dog than the daughter, said Holmes sternly.

00:34:35,130 --> 00:34:41,880
Watson, see to the young lady. Miss Rucastle, you are free now. No man shall lay hands upon you

00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:47,820
again. Hiss out, the girl clung to me, trembling, while Rucastle raged and cursed over the fallen

00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:52,860
brute. At that moment, the pale figure of Mrs. Rucastle appeared, drawn by the noise. She gave

00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:57,300
one look at the scene and flung herself upon her knees beside the young woman, clasping her in her

00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,120
arms. Alice, my poor child, she sobbed. Forgive me, I was powerless to aid you.

00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:05,519
..

00:35:05,519 --> 00:35:09,880
Mother, the girl cried, and the two wept in each other's arms.

00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,060
...

00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:15,800
Holmes, with a gesture of his hand, beckoned me away from the touching seat.

00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:23,519
Come, Watson, he said. Our work here is merely done. The law must settle the rest. But justice,

00:35:23,519 --> 00:35:26,819
in a measure, has already been achieved.

00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:28,929
And so we left the copper beaches,

00:35:28,929 --> 00:35:31,449
the moonlight glimmering upon its somber wards.

00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,590
It behind us echoed the sobs of the reunited mother and daughter,

00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,119
mingled with the curses of a man

00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,840
whose wickedness had brought his own downfall.

00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,670
We quitted the copper beaches,

00:35:40,670 --> 00:35:42,569
in the stillness of the midnight hour,

00:35:42,569 --> 00:35:45,849
Holmes and I walking silently side by side along the country lane.

00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:48,159
Behind us, the house loomed dark and heavy,

00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:51,039
while the grove of ratty beaches swayed gently in the night air.

00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,409
My mind was crowded with tumultuous impressions.

00:35:53,409 --> 00:35:59,019
The pale face of Alice Rucastle, the frenzy of her father, the faithful courage of Violet Hunter,

00:35:59,019 --> 00:36:04,079
above all, the swift and decisive manner in which Holmes had pierced the veil of deception

00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,559
filled me with renewed admiration. Holmes, I said at last, breaking the silence,

00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:14,050
once again you have torn the mask from a villain and restored freedom to the oppressed.

00:36:14,050 --> 00:36:18,940
Yet I confess my mind still gropes in some darkness. Will you not set forth the whole

00:36:18,940 --> 00:36:20,960
chain of reasoning by which you arrived at the truth?

00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:28,420
"'Rillingly, my dear Watson,' Holmes replied, his tone calm as ever, though his eyes

00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:36,340
geaned with inward satisfaction. The case, though dramatic in its unfolding, was built upon very

00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:44,039
simple foundations. From the first, the conditions imposed upon Miss Hunter were so eccentric as to

00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:51,599
demand explanation. Why the blue dress? Why the cutting of her hair? Why the enforced posture

00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,139
at the window, each pointed inevitably to impersonation? Yes, I perceived that when

00:36:58,139 --> 00:37:04,079
you hinted it, I said, but for whose sake was the impersonation contrived? That, Watson,

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,820
was the crux. A wealthy salary for trivial duties could only mean that the service rendered was not

00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:18,700
the act of a governess, but of a decoy. The resemblance between Miss Hunter and some other

00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:25,120
person in the household was therefore certain. When we saw Miss Hunter's figure in the window

00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:32,059
and the watcher among the trees, the matter declared itself. The man outside was the one

00:37:32,059 --> 00:37:38,059
to whom the sight was directed. He must be connected with the family, and who more likely

00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:40,019
than the daughter herself.

00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,429
And the locked wing,

00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:42,680
the sobbing at night,

00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:44,239
these confirmed it.

00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,989
Hmm, precisely.

00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:47,840
Hmm, the daughter.

00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,500
Alice Rucastle had been kept prisoner

00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:53,219
that her father might control her fortune

00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:54,579
or prevent her union

00:37:54,579 --> 00:37:57,099
with one of whom he disapproved.

00:37:57,099 --> 00:37:58,569
When she resisted,

00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:01,460
he resorted to cruel confinement.

00:38:01,460 --> 00:38:04,320
But to quiet suspicion among friends

00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,480
or perhaps to mislead her lover

00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,019
if he sought her out,

00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:12,639
He employed our brave Miss Hunter to impersonate her at the window.

00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:19,689
Thus, the absent one was seemingly present, and inquiries might be diverted.

00:38:19,689 --> 00:38:23,989
As Holmes spoke, the whole dark scheme grew plain before me.

00:38:23,989 --> 00:38:27,059
I could see the wretched Alice immured within her chamber,

00:38:27,059 --> 00:38:30,760
while her likeness was played by another to deceive the eyes of her suitor,

00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:32,789
lingering desperately outside.

00:38:32,789 --> 00:38:36,259
Your surmise about the chained dog was no less accurate, I remarked.

00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:43,770
Ah, yes, Carlo, he was their final safeguard, set to deter intrusion upon that side passage.

00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:52,100
Yet in his very ferocity lay our deliverance, for when the beast fell, Rucastle's power fell with him.

00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:56,740
Without his fangs to guard the secret, the prison door stood open.

00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:57,900
Oh!

00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:03,040
We walked on in silence for a time, the lane stretching white before us beneath the moon.

00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:08,680
I said, what of Miss Hunter? She has borne herself with a courage most rare.

00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,719
What future awaits her? Think you?

00:39:10,719 --> 00:39:19,359
Miss Hunter, Holmes answered gravely, is one of those women who ennoble their sex by quiet bravery.

00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,220
I have seldom met a character more resolute or more steadfast.

00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:28,059
She will, I believe, find happiness in her profession.

00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:31,579
perhaps even establish a school of her own

00:39:31,579 --> 00:39:35,170
where her independence and strength may flourish.

00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:38,289
Such a woman does not lack for a future.

00:39:38,289 --> 00:39:42,260
His words proved true as I learned later, as I learned later.

00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:45,349
Violet Hunter, with the capitals she had prudently saved,

00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,279
did in time open a school at Walsall

00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:50,099
where she achieved both prosperity and respect.

00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,500
I often recall her bright courage

00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,920
when I think of the perils women must endure in their solitary employments.

00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,599
The next day, after due communication with the local authorities, the matter of Geoffrey

00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,840
Rukasil was placed in their hands.

00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:03,569
Sabba!

00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:08,500
He, the unhappy man, thwarted and disarmed, sank into a state of collapse from which he

00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,720
never wholly recovered.

00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:14,220
His wife, released from fear, devoted herself to her daughter, and thus some measure of

00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:16,810
peace was restored within those sombre walls.

00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:22,090
And yet, Holmes, I said, as we prepared to return to London, one thing puzzles me still.

00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,220
And what of the lover who watched from the trees?

00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:25,690
What part did he play?

00:40:25,690 --> 00:40:32,359
Ah, Watson, you touch the heart of the matter, Holmes replied, his voice softer than usual.

00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:39,659
That man was Mr. Fowler, a gentleman of honourable intentions, who had sought Alice's hand,

00:40:39,659 --> 00:40:44,550
who Castle, greedy of her fortune and unwilling to surrender his authority,

00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:51,139
contrived her imprisonment to prevent the match. Fowler, faithful and persevering,

00:40:51,139 --> 00:40:58,659
haunted the place, hoping for some sign of her. It was to him that the false Alice was displayed.

00:40:58,659 --> 00:41:06,989
Thus the cruel deception was aimed at breaking his hope. Happily, it failed. With Alice's release,

00:41:06,989 --> 00:41:14,239
the two were reunited, and I trust they will find the happiness so long denied them.

00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:19,659
Hapig doubt. Then indeed justice has been done, I said warmly.

00:41:19,659 --> 00:41:27,139
Justice, yes, Holmes mused, though often in this world justice comes limping and mercy

00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,089
follows far behind.

00:41:29,089 --> 00:41:37,219
Let us be content that in this case, at least, suffering has been relieved and love vindicated.

00:41:37,219 --> 00:41:43,119
The copper beaches will stand long in memory, not for the house itself, but for the shadows

00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:44,279
it concealed.

00:41:44,279 --> 00:41:45,399
Well, aye.

00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,100
Thus ended our adventure among the beaches of Hampshire.

00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:52,789
As we sat once more in our familiar sitting room in Baker Street,

00:41:52,789 --> 00:41:55,700
I reflected upon the strange contrasts of human life

00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,559
that beneath the peaceful surface of an English country house

00:41:58,559 --> 00:42:01,309
should lurk cruelty, deceit and greed,

00:42:01,309 --> 00:42:03,750
and that out of such darkness should emerge courage,

00:42:03,750 --> 00:42:05,050
devotion and love.

00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:07,440
And I thought to myself, as often before,

00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,320
that it was my privilege beyond measure

00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,239
to walk beside Sherlock Holmes,

00:42:11,239 --> 00:42:13,619
whose keen mind could pierce the veil of crime

00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:16,689
and bring light to the hidden corners of the human heart.

00:42:16,689 --> 00:42:21,199
Another case for your chronicles, Watson, Holmes said,

00:42:21,199 --> 00:42:24,569
as he stretched himself languidly upon the sofa.

00:42:24,569 --> 00:42:27,399
But do not make me too infallible.

00:42:27,399 --> 00:42:32,859
The public must see the detective as a man, not as a miracle.

00:42:32,859 --> 00:42:33,880
..

00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,760
As a man, Holmes, I laughed.

00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,309
There never was man's reason more miraculous.

00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:41,900
And so, while London's hum rose once more outside our window,

00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,829
Quaise, a venture of the copper beeches was laid to rest.

00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:48,989
Yet even now, when the spring winds stir the branches of country lanes,

00:42:48,989 --> 00:42:52,600
I see again in memory those dark trees, that lonely house,

00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,820
and the brave young woman who sought our aid.

00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:55,000
.
