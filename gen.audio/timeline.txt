5.240000: It is among the peculiar fortunes of my life that I should have been permitted to record so many of.
3.120000: The adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Sashlock Holmes,
4.540000: whose genius for observation and deduction has seldom, if ever, been equal.
2.940000: Many of these cases have lain unpublished for years,
4.350000: whether through the delicacy of those involved or the simple eccentricity of my friend,
2.360000: who often regarded publicity with disdain.
5.230000: But there are others, hidden in my notes, which I now feel compelled to bring to light.
3.780000: One of these is what I have called the adventure of the doing suitcase,
4.380000: a mystery that began with the most unexpected visitation to our lodgings in Baker Street
3.280000: on a fog-shrouded evening in the autumn of 1887.
1.060000: ..
3.820000: Holmes was, at that time, immersed in one of his chemical experiments
3.420000: involving a retort of bubbling liquid that hissed ominously
2.640000: whenever he added a pinch of some crystalline powder.
4.520000: The air of our sitting room was thick with an acrid smoke which brought tears to my eyes
2.800000: and compelled me to retreat behind my medical journal,
2.800000: though my friend seemed quite oblivious to its effects.
2.900000: His long fingers moved with the delicacy of a surgeon
3.270000: as he measured, stirred and observed the strange reaction,
4.360000: humming to himself in that low tone he reserved for moments of complete concentration.
2.630000: Holmes, I really must protest that your laboratory practices
2.550000: will be the ruin of both our lungs, bro-jay.
2.740000: This room is already close to unbearable.
1.070000: It bearable.
0.820000: Some...
1.360000: My dear Watson,
4.480000: A man's lungs are robust enough to withstand a little chlorine vapour.
2.280000: ...
4.640000: Whereas the mind is far more fragile and requires constant exercise
2.860000: if it is not to wither into flabbiness.
7.550000: Yet you will forgive me if I confess that I do not see how breeding poison gas can possibly improve one's mental faculties.
2.850000: Ah, but there you are, my good fellow.
4.840000: This experiment is a test of certain phosphorescent compounds
8.360000: and from it we may gain an insight into the curious behavior of matter when stimulated by chemical energy.
7.100000: In such investigations lies the seed of deductions which may one day solve a case of crime most singular.
1.100000: ..
4.300000: Kohns' pronouncements, as ever, struck me as at once maddening and profound.
3.780000: I had learned long ago that it was useless to debate his peculiar hobbies.
5.280000: It was at that moment, however, that our conversation was interrupted by a loud knock at the door below.
11.720000: Mrs. Hudson's familiar tread ascended the staircase, and presently she ushered into our room a visitor whose appearance was so remarkable that I instantly set down my journal and gave him my full attention.
5.700000: The man was tall, though slightly stooped, with garments of fine cut, but sadly neglected condition.
9.060000: His hair, which might once have been fair, was streaked with grey, and his eyes darted about the room with a nervous energy that bespoke intense agitation.
4.890000: Most striking of all, however, was the object he carried, a large leather suitcase,
6.160000: which he bore with both hands as though it were a treasure of immense value or a burden of unbearable weight.
5.400000: Gentlemen, forgive me for intruding at such an hour, but I have come to you in desperation.
5.270000: My name is Arthur Phelps and I am in dire need of Mr. Sherlock Holmes' advice.
4.260000: You could not have come at a better time, Mr. Phelps.
6.000000: Pray, be seated, and do not hesitate to place that curious case upon the table.
9.410000: My friend and colleague Dr. Watson will vouch that no circumstance, however strange, is without its proper explanation,
4.820000: if only we apply the powers of observation and deduction.
2.760000: You seem in considerable distress, sir.
4.730000: Perhaps, if you begin at the beginning, we may the better understand what assistance you require.
4.110000: Mr. Arthur Phelps placed the suitcase on our table with an audible thud.
4.330000: I was startled to perceive that a faint glow seemed to emanate from the seams of the leather,
2.270000: as though some hidden light pulsed within.
2.590000: The effect was ghostly and most uncanny,
4.030000: casting a pale radiance upon Holmes' thin, hawk-like features.
2.810000: You observe it at once, Doctor.
3.800000: That glow has been the torment of my existence these past three nights.
2.840000: It began after the case came into my possession,
3.400000: and I swear to you, I have not dared to open it.
2.660000: Surely you know what the suitcase contains?
2.450000: That, sir, is the riddle.
2.800000: The case was delivered to my residence without explanation,
1.950000: sealed and addressed in my name.
2.490000: There was no letter, no sender,
2.330000: and when the lights of my chamber were extinguished,
3.620000: I perceived this infernal glow seeping from within.
1.020000: ..
0.770000: Fascinating.
3.910000: The glow, Watson, is unmistakably chemical in nature,
5.770000: phosphorescence perhaps, or some other luminescent reaction confined within.
3.870000: Observe the manner in which the seams pulse rhythmically,
2.430000: almost as though the thing were breathing.
4.130000: That detail alone rules out any ordinary cause.
2.740000: Holmes, I cannot deny the effect is unsettling.
4.000000: It seems unnatural, as though the case harboured some living creature.
6.240000: And yet, my good fellow, to suppose it harbours life is to leap beyond the evidence.
4.610000: Mr. Phelps, you say this case was delivered to you.
1.750000: By what means precisely?
1.280000: ..
4.980000: By a cabman, sir, who claimed he had been instructed by a gentleman he could not describe.
4.020000: He handed me the case, accepted no fee and vanished before I could press him with questions.
1.280000: ..
4.270000: A cabman who accepts no fare is an anomaly indeed.
1.170000: Note that, Watson.
3.540000: It suggests the fellow was in the employ of another,
6.220000: perhaps under strict orders to deliver his charge without engaging in conversation.
1.260000: ..
3.860000: And since then you have not opened the suitcase though it bears your name?
2.850000: No, doctor. My courage failed me.
3.650000: At first I thought it some ghastly trick but each night the glow intensifies
2.840000: and last evening I swear I heard a faint humming from within
2.640000: like the murmur of bees behind a wall.
4.300000: Most intriguing. Tell me, Mr. Phelps, what is your occupation?
2.380000: ...
3.550000: I am employed at the Foreign Office, sir, in a rather humble capacity,
3.310000: though I am sometimes entrusted with confidential documents.
3.970000: Ah, that alters the complexion of the case considerably.
4.530000: You will agree, Watson, that the sudden arrival of a mysterious case
6.300000: addressed to a government official must be weighed in the balance of international intrigue.
5.280000: Indeed, Holmes, I cannot help but think of spies and agents seeking to convey some perilous device.
5.750000: Just so. Mr. Phelps, have you enemies, either personal or political?
6.270000: None that I know of, sir. My life is of the quietest, and I have never sought prominence.
5.900000: Yet prominence may have sought you, if you have handled certain papers of value.
4.380000: .....
5.320000: Very well. If the first step is clear, Watson, hand me my lens.
4.680000: We shall subject this suitcase to the most careful examination.
8.020000: Though I warn you both, I will not yet open it until I have exhausted every possible observation of its exterior.
17.300000: ..................
3.280000: himself in rapid phrases I could scarcely follow.
3.920000: Note the absence of scratches about the lock, Watson.
3.440000: This tells us that our client has spoken the truth.
2.760000: He has not attempted to force it.
5.860000: Observe also this faint residue upon the handle, a powdery substance, faintly luminous in its
1.320000: own right.
6.940000: This is no mere trick of reflection, but a true phosphor compound, of which very few
1.000000: are known.
4.080000: Then the glow is intentional, Holmes, a device prepared by some chemist?
1.630000: Precisely so.
5.010000: The question becomes, what motive lies behind such an elaborate contrivance?
6.680000: To inspire fear, to conceal a treasure, or to serve as a signal visible at night?
1.060000: ..
4.760000: You speak of it so calmly, Mr. Holmes, while to me it has been a torment beyond endurance.
1.240000: ..
3.840000: Calmness, my dear sir, is the true ally of reason.
2.800000: Fear is the enemy of deduction
3.460000: Rest assured, before the night is over
5.220000: We shall know far more of this singular object than we do now
2.300000: Holmes straightened at last
2.140000: His eyes alight with the fire of discovery
0.770000: Pot!
1.490000: And I could see that to him
2.540000: The Bueing suitcase was not an object of terror
1.340000: But a fascination
3.460000: A challenge to be unraveled by the tools of science and logic
1.100000: He moved to the mantel
1.700000: Lit his pipe with deliberate care
3.090000: and sent up three puffs of smoke before speaking again.
2.320000: Hmm. Mr. Hmm.
4.370000: Phelps, I must ask whether any of your colleagues at the Foreign Office
4.410000: might bear ill will toward you or be tempted by bribery.
3.730000: Even the humblest clerk may stumble upon a document
3.720000: whose value is beyond reckoning to a foreign power.
6.140000: I have considered that possibility, Mr. N.O. Mabel, Citrio 4, Citrio 4, Holmes.
3.120000: but I cannot think of one who would single me out in such a manner.
1.020000: ..
5.080000: And yet here we are with an inexplicable object thrust into your possession.
2.090000: No coincidence, Watson.
5.360000: In matters of this sort, coincidence is the mask of design.
2.190000: Then you suspect espionage, Holmes?
2.900000: I suspect nothing, I observe.
5.880000: And what I observe is that the sender of this suitcase has gone to extraordinary lengths
6.300000: to ensure it reaches Mr. Phelps intact, unmolested and glowing
3.090000: with an aura designed to confound.
4.230000: That suggests intelligence and deliberate planning.
3.420000: What we must uncover is the purpose.
1.220000: ..
3.110000: The gyo from the suitcase seemed to brighten as Holmes spoke,
1.530000: as though mocking our ignorance.
4.780000: Mr. Phelps sat wringing his hands, his face pale in the ghastly light.
2.200000: For my part, I could not suppress a shiver.
4.070000: though I told myself it was only the late autumn chill seeping through the window panes.
4.930000: The reader will recall that we had reached the point where Mr. Mind, where Mr. Arthur Phelps,
4.240000: a clerk in the foreign office, had placed upon our table a suitcase that glowed with a mysterious
4.620000: inner light. Holmes, after a minute examination, had pronounced the effect chemical in origin,
4.750000: though its purpose remained uncertain. The tension of that first evening did not diminish.
4.510000: Indeed, as the clock chimed nine, I felt that the very walls of Baker Street vibrated
2.310000: with the unspoken promise of danger.
2.340000: Holmes alone appeared supremely at ease,
2.790000: puffing upon his pipe while Mr. Delejust Desham
2.130000: felt sat in visible torment.
4.790000: Watson, be so good as to recording your notebook
3.820000: the precise description of our client's visitor.
2.210000: The Gabman!
2.430000: You will recall, Mr. Phelps,
3.870000: every detail you can of this mysterious fellow,
1.510000: no matter how trivial.
6.520000: It was dark, sir, and the fog thick, but I remember his voice rough, London-born, and
0.860000: tinged with cottony.
3.500000: His coat was of shabby brown, and he wore a cap pull low.
2.410000: Beyond that, I cannot say.
1.760000: That would suffice.
2.630000: A cabman of the old school, no doubt.
1.680000: Note it down, Watson.
2.470000: The absence of payment is key.
5.780000: Our driver was employed under orders, and orders always leave a trail.
2.420000: Cabs may vanish into the fog,
4.370000: but their numbers remain written in the ledgers of the city.
2.200000: Then you propose to track him through the registry?
1.020000: ..
0.840000: Precisely.
4.240000: Tomorrow, Watson, we shall make a pilgrimage to the cab yard.
3.400000: But before that, there is work to be done this evening.
4.920000: I must learn whether the glow is merely surface phosphorescence
3.810000: or if it originates from within the case itself.
2.210000: You will not open it, Mr. Holmes.
17.000000: not yet my dear sir to open a sealed container without knowledge of its contents is folly of the worst order it may be harmless or it may be a device contrived to injure patience is the ally of safety
5.090000: Holmes drew from his cabinet a small glass prism and a handheld spectroscope of his own design.
4.040000: He set these upon the table beside the suitcase and adjusted the lamp,
3.500000: so that the faint glow from the seams might be refracted through the instrument.
3.870000: I watched, fascinated, as he bent his keen eyes to the lens.
5.320000: As I suspected, Watson, the glow is of a narrow spectral band.
3.320000: It corresponds to the emission of phosphorus compounds,
5.500000: but the purity suggests refinement beyond the reach of an amateur.
3.330000: Someone with training in chemistry has arranged this.
2.700000: Observe the steadiness of the glow.
5.910000: It does not fade as common phosphors do, but maintains a regular intensity.
2.850000: Ah, this is deliberate.
3.480000: Then we are dealing with a chemist of some ability, Holmes.
5.390000: More than ability precision that limits the field of possible culprits,
4.370000: Ah, not many in London could contrive such an effect.
3.190000: But what purpose could such a strange contrivance serve?
5.800000: We must resist the temptation to leap ahead of the evidence, Mr. Feltz.
2.210000: Purpose will emerge in due time.
5.690000: For now, the glow itself is a clue, an unmistakable signature.
5.020000: Someone wanted you, and only you, to have this suitcase
2.320000: and to be tormented by its appearance.
13.000000: The unease in the room was palpable. I confess that the ghastly glow seemed to have settled into my very nerves, and I could not shake the impression that the suitcase was something alive. Holmes, however, resumed his seat with perfect composure.
4.610000: Watson, tomorrow you and I shall rise early.
3.720000: There is a cabman to be found, Mr. Salmon.
3.410000: Perhaps I advise you to remain here tonight.
3.960000: You will be safer under my roof than in your own lodgings,
2.880000: which may well be under observation.
3.970000: The case will remain here under my protection.
2.910000: I am grateful beyond words, Mr. Holmes.
1.320000: Thus it was arranged.
2.720000: That night I slept fitfully in the guest chamber
3.720000: for I could not banish the eerie image of the going case from my thoughts.
4.630000: It seemed to pulse in my dreams like a phantom heart beating in the silence of the night.
4.240000: The following morning dawned bleak and drizzly, yet Hones was in his element.
2.710000: He strode forth into the mist with his coat buttoned to the chin
2.690000: and his cane tapping briskly upon the pavement.
3.360000: I accompanied him faithfully, though with less enthusiasm,
4.590000: and we soon reached a yard where dozens of handsome cabs stood in grim procession,
2.820000: their drivers lounging about with pipes and muds of tea.
5.870000: Good morning, gentlemen. I am in search of a driver who, three nights past,
4.350000: conveyed a parcel to Bedford Square without accepting a fare.
6.060000: A singular circumstance, and one which must surely have been remarked upon.
3.340000: Well now, governor, that rings a bell, it does.
4.460000: Jim Hardy, that be the chap, took a queer box to some gentleman's door
2.600000: and wouldn't take so much as a penny for his trouble.
2.900000: Said his instructions was clear as daylight.
4.100000: Excellent! And where may I find this Mr. Hardy?
5.360000: You'll catch him of an evening at the Red Lion Tavern, down near Holborn.
4.640000: My thanks! You have rendered a service to justice today.
4.960000: With this clue in hand, Holmes led me away, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.
3.680000: Holmes, do you truly believe this cabman will yield us the truth?
6.160000: Every man yields the truth, Watson, though it must sometimes be coaxed by the right method.
4.650000: Tonight we shall pay a visit to the Red Lion.
3.000000: Evening found us in that smoky establishment,
3.500000: the air thick with the odour of ale and the clamour of voices.
4.170000: In one dim corner sat a burly fellow with a cap pull low,
3.210000: whose weathered face betrayed a life upon the streets.
2.530000: Holmes approached with his customary directness.
2.560000: You are Jim Hardy, I believe,
3.790000: that cabman who delivered the case to Bedford Square three nights ago?
3.020000: Aye, that's me. And what of it, sir?
5.820000: What of it is that the case you delivered is of the utmost importance?
5.750000: Tell me who employed you, and you may save yourself considerable trouble.
3.690000: Trouble, is it? Well, I know naught of the matter.
3.700000: A gent with a muffler over his face hailed me near King's Cross,
3.670000: put the case in me cap, and told me to deliver it to that address.
3.890000: He paid me handsome due, more than a month's fares.
16.670000: said not to take payment at the door that's the long and short of it did you catch his voice his manner anything distinctive deep voice foreign perhaps though i couldn't swear walked with a bit of a limb i think ebb to the shadows
11.560000: foreign and limping most instructive did you see from which train he came at king's cross that i did not sir he was already on the pavement when i arrived
9.220000: very well mr hardy your honesty does you credit keep yourself available for the matter may yet require further testimony
2.920000: Holmes pressed a coin into the man's palm and withdrew
2.580000: His face, as we stepped again into the fog
4.800000: was alight with that peculiar satisfaction he reserved for a trail that had grown warm
2.760000: Holmes, you look as though the game were afoot
2.480000: Indeed, Watson, it is
2.040000: A foreigner with a limp
2.260000: employing a phosphorescent device
2.560000: and targeting a clerk in the foreign office
3.360000: Already the outlines of the picture begin to form
6.010000: Hence, the next step will be to examine Mr. Phelps' position more closely.
7.150000: There may be documents he has handled in recent weeks which are of value to a foreign power.
6.750000: And so, when we returned to Baker Street, Holmes set about interrogating Mr. Phelps with relentless precision,
5.870000: drawing forth every detail of his duties, the documents entrusted to him and the colleagues with whom he had contact.
6.360000: There was perhaps one matter, a memorandum concerning new telegraph codes, of which I
2.560000: made a fair copy for my superior.
3.940000: It was not of great importance, or so I thought.
6.640000: On the contrary, Mr. Feltz, to a foreign agent new codes are of supreme importance.
4.580000: A single cipher broken and whole networks may collapse.
5.700000: This suitcase, therefore, may be either a lure or a warning.
3.310000: A warning, Holmes, but from whom and to what end?
3.710000: That, Watson, is the heart of the mystery.
3.840000: Was the glowing case meant to frighten our client into silence
2.090000: or to draw him into some trap?
2.650000: Until we open it, we cannot see.
4.570000: But rest assured, we shall open it when the time is right.
2.440000: Thus part two of the affair concluded,
2.080000: with the suitcase still locked upon our table,
1.770000: glowing with its eerie light,
2.380000: while Holmes's mind whirled with deductions
6.350000: and I, for my part, would only marvel at the strange net of intrigue into which we had been drawn.
4.200000: The suitcase remained upon our sitting-room table, like a silent sentinel,
5.830000: its glow casting strange shadows upon the bookshelves and the familiar clutter of our Baker Street lodgings.
3.080000: For three nights it had pulsed with that uncanny radiance,
2.740000: yet Holmes had resisted the temptation to force the lock.
3.520000: His restraint, I must admit, was a source of frustration to me,
4.040000: though he assured me repeatedly that patience was as necessary in detection
2.190000: as courage upon the battlefield.
4.650000: Watson, to fling open this case without precaution
2.360000: would be the act of a fool.
2.640000: It may contain documents of state
3.160000: or it may contain something designed
2.750000: to destroy those who pry.
2.610000: Only by approaching it scientifically
3.620000: can we assure both safety and certainty.
1.100000: ..
2.060000: I grant you the necessity of caution, Holmes.
4.110000: Hymns, yet I confess the suspense has gnawed at me most cruelly.
2.720000: I feel as though that case has watched us these three nights,
2.240000: like a beast crouched in the corner.
3.700000: A beast, perhaps, but a chained one, my dear fellow.
2.950000: Let us unchain it with the proper tools.
3.340000: On the morning of the fourth day, Holmes dispatched a deli-glam
3.760000: to a colleague of his acquaintance at St. Z, Bartholomew's laboratory,
2.200000: requesting certain apparatus, coys.
4.140000: By afternoon, these had arrived, rubber gloves, a set of delicate forceps,
3.500000: a shallow basin of sand and a large bell jar of thick glass.
3.480000: The appearance of these objects did little to soothe Mr. Phelps
2.390000: who paced the carpet with restless steps.
3.040000: Mr. Holmes, if it is indeed some infernal device,
2.870000: I fear the consequences of meddling with it.
2.140000: Should we not rather consign it to the authorities?
1.140000: ..
5.980000: And thereby warn those very persons who may be seeking to undermine your department?
2.160000: No, Mr. Phelps!
7.540000: To thrust this into official hands would be to lose all chance of independent deduction.
5.340000: The matter is safest here, where science and reason may probe it undisturbed.
17.120000: ..................
13.240000: now watson observe i shall attempt first to test for fumes a fine puncture through the lever with this hollow needle and we shall know whether anything volatile lies within
12.280000: he worked with steady hand clicking the side of the case and attaching the needle to a small tube which led into a dish of pure water for seven minutes we watched breathless but no bubble rose no vapour escaped
16.620000: satisfactory there is no gaseous trap the next test is for weight watson lift it gently i did so and was surprised to find it heavier than i expected it must be full of something dense holmes it is far too heavy for papers alone
3.420000: Precisely. That tells us much.
1.620000: Now, for the lock.
1.980000: Observe the workmanship.
3.960000: It is common brass, of a type sold at many shops,
2.580000: yet it has been oiled recently.
3.940000: That suggests it was sealed only a short time ago.
1.840000: ..
3.170000: Very well. We shall open it under the jar.
1.910000: Stand ready, Watson.
3.620000: With deft movements, Holmes inserted his pick and warped the mechanism.
3.840000: The click of the lock releasing echoed unnaturally in the silence.
5.970000: He withdrew the pick and with slow deliberation lifted the lid of the case beneath the safety of the bell jar.
8.180000: Once the blow burst forth more fiercely, flooding the jar with a greenish light that illuminated Holmes' sharp profile like a lantern held from within.
1.650000: Good heavens, Holmes!
1.840000: Saints preserve us.
8.490000: Within the suitcase lay a strange object, a box of polished metal upon which was set a series of glass tubes filled with some luminescent substance.
6.790000: Tubes glowed with steady brilliance and tiny wires ran between them to a small coil of copper at one side.
6.700000: Remarkable! An electrical phosphorescent apparatus. Quite ingenious!
7.250000: Someone has contrived to sustain the glow by a concealed battery and a chemical compound.
6.700000: This is no ordinary contrivance, but the work of an expert in experimental physics.
4.220000: But why encase such a thing in a suitcase and deliver it to our client?
3.420000: That is the heart of the puzzle, Watson.
4.310000: Observe further beneath the apparatus lies a bundle of papers.
2.180000: Yes, here they are.
3.140000: Holmes drew forth several documents sealed with red tape.
1.910000: He spread them upon the table by Mr.
1.170000: Why, Mr.
2.580000: Phelps bent forward anxiously.
3.120000: My God, those are drafts of the telegraph code.
2.280000: They should be in the custody of my superior.
1.840000: yet here they lie before me.
4.370000: Indeed, it seems, Mr. Febbs,
6.610000: that you have been made the unwilling custodian of contraband of the highest order.
4.370000: Whoever placed this case in your hands intended you to be suspected of theft.
4.970000: Should the papers be discovered, it is a trap most devilish in its cunning.
1.020000: ..
2.220000: Then our client stands in glaive peril, Holmes.
3.600000: If the authorities knew of this, suspicion would fall upon him at once.
7.780000: Precisely, which is why we must move swiftly. Already the trail grows cold. The cabman's
6.630000: employer, the foreigner with the limp, is the key. We must identify him before he strikes again.
4.920000: But what of the apparatus? What am I to do with these cursed documents?
6.610000: Leave them in my keeping, Mr. Phelps. Yeah, they shall be restored to their rightful place
3.130000: once I have traced the chain to its origin.
2.710000: As for the apparatus, it is a signal.
1.360000: Make no mistake.
2.510000: The girl was intended to be seen,
2.070000: perhaps by an accomplice,
2.400000: watching from without your window.
3.660000: He would know the case had reached its destination.
3.210000: Then, Viva Azad's observed homes?
1.300000: Possibly.
2.950000: Baker Street is not immune to eyes in the dark.
4.330000: We must therefore act as though every move is watched.
6.470000: The thought sent a chill through me to think that even in our sanctuary we might be under surveillance was unnerving indeed.
2.990000: Holmes, however, seemed invigorated by the challenge.
3.200000: Watson, you will accompany me this evening.
5.140000: There is a man in the East End, an electrician of dubious reputation,
3.950000: who may have had the skill to construct such a device.
1.700000: His name is Zacharias Holt.
3.590000: If my deductions are correct, he may also limp.
1.710000: Then tonight we hunt our quarry?
3.960000: Tonight, my dear fellow, the game is truly afoot.
26.040000: ...........................
7.400000: cracks. Horns knocked sharply. Open in the name of business. Who's there? I keep no eyes for strangers.
7.690000: A fellow in need of certain huminescent compounds, Mr. Holt. Or shall I call you by another name,
6.530000: the limping gentleman of King's Cross? There was a sudden scraping within. Then the door opened a
5.520000: crack. A man stood revealed, thin as a whip, his left leg dragging slightly as he shifted his weight.
3.420000: His face was pale, his eyes quick and suspicious.
2.760000: You are mistaken, sir. I am no cab-haunter.
1.540000: ..
0.600000: Mistaken?
1.300000: ..
2.460000: Then perhaps you can explain
3.280000: why the phosphorescent mixture in your window display
2.200000: is identical in spectrum
5.040000: to that found upon the suitcase handle of Mr. Arthur Phelps.
3.580000: Holt started visibly, his eyes darting to left and right,
1.340000: as though seeking escape.
2.220000: Holmes, he means to flee.
3.750000: Not while your stout frame blocks the door, Watson.
7.200000: Mister, hold. I suggest you come quietly, for I assure you the net is already around you.
4.370000: You meddle in affairs beyond your ken. Do you think you can stop what has already begun?
2.860000: That remains to be seen.
5.120000: You will accompany us to Baker Street, where you will answer certain questions.
5.050000: Refuse, and I hand you to Scotland Yard this very night.
4.730000: The man glared at Holmes, but at last his shoulders sagged in resignation.
2.930000: With a limp more pronounced than before, he stepped into the street.
2.540000: Thus we secured our first tangible suspect,
3.270000: though what further secrets he might reveal was yet to be determined.
3.800000: It was with no small sense of triumph that Holmes and I returned to Baker Street
4.360000: with our reluctant, hmm, companion, hmm, Zacharias hold.
4.500000: The man shuffled along beside us, his limp accentuated by every step,
3.310000: his pale face betraying a mixture of defiance and dread,
3.770000: The fog still clung to the city, muffling the sound of the handsome weeds,
2.890000: so that it seemed we travelled in some spectral procession.
3.600000: Mr. Holmes, Arthur Phelps awaited us anxiously in our rooms,
3.650000: his eyes widening in astonishment at the sight of our prisoner.
2.780000: Good heavens, Mr. Holmes, who is this?
3.440000: A man of science, Mr. Phelps,
5.740000: though his talents have strayed from the laboratory into darker employments.
6.900000: Mr. Zacharias Holt, known in certain circles as an electrician of ingenuity
7.080000: and known to us as the builder of the phosphorescent device we discovered within your suitcase.
1.200000: ..
2.980000: He denied his guilt when we confronted him, Holmes.
6.170000: Naturally, Watson. A guilty man seldom proclaims himself so at threshold.
4.110000: But denial is a fragile shield against deduction.
6.790000: Now, Mr. Holt, sit here by the fire and let us converse plainly.
4.070000: Holt dropped heavily into the chair, his long fingers twitching upon his knees.
5.280000: His eyes flickered nervously toward the bewing suitcase still under the bell jar upon the table.
3.120000: You built that apparatus, did you not?
2.800000: Do not waste our time with falsehoods.
3.980000: The spectrum of your phosphorescent compound matches it precisely.
4.330000: The copper coils are of a design peculiar to your shop.
3.450000: The evidence is irrefutable.
1.300000: ..
1.340000: And if I admit it, what then?
2.920000: A man must eat and there are those who pay handsomely for my skills.
1.060000: ..
1.960000: Indeed, but in this case,
4.010000: your payment has placed an innocent clerk under suspicion of treachery.
1.590000: For whom do you work?
2.040000: That is the question.
1.720000: I cannot tell you.
1.640000: ..
1.780000: Cannot or will not?
4.700000: Call it what you like. You do not know the men who stand behind me.
3.150000: To speak their names is to sign my own debt warrant.
4.130000: And yet, to withhold them may sign another's.
1.720000: Consider carefully.
5.060000: The telegraph codes within that case are of supreme importance to the government.
3.640000: Their theft could plunge this nation into disaster.
7.310000: Do you wish to be remembered as the man who unmade his country for the sake of a few coins?
3.610000: You speak as though I had choice in the matter. I was approached, compelled.
5.340000: Wahan, the man with the limp, you think me he, but there is another. He is my master, not I.
4.680000: Another limping man? Then who are you, if not the figure seen at King's Cross?
5.480000: I am but the artificer. A true director of this business is a foreign agent, a man they call Von Kruger.
4.300000: At last, a name. Von Kruger Watson.
5.620000: You may recall that I mentioned a German operative active in London these past months.
3.720000: His methods are subtle, his agents well placed.
4.170000: If Holt speaks truth, we have stumbled upon his scheme.
3.370000: But why target me? I am of little consequence at the Foreign Office.
1.280000: ..
5.170000: Precisely, Mr. Phelps. You were chosen because you are obscure.
6.040000: A packet of codes disappearing from the desk of a senior official would cause an uproar.
5.050000: But to place them upon a minor clerk who better to serve as scapegoat?
7.090000: When discovery came, suspicion would fall upon you, leaving the true thief unsuspected.
2.240000: A blood most devilish, Holmes.
1.610000: Indeed, Watson.
3.130000: Halt! Your silence will not shield you.
4.570000: Von Kruger uses you as he uses all his instruments.
4.370000: Speak now, and perhaps you may escape the noose.
1.420000: After a long pause.
2.390000: Very well. He may already suspect me compromised.
1.060000: I will tell you what I know.
3.180000: Von Kruger commanded me to construct a glowing device as a signal.
3.950000: The light was to shine through Mr. Phelps's window, visible to watchers in the street.
5.040000: Its purpose was not only to frighten him, but to confirm to Von Kruger's associates that the codes had been delivered.
4.230000: A signal, just as I suspected. Go on.
5.210000: That is all. I was to deliver the device through an intermediary. Beyond that, I know nothing.
7.450000: You know more than you confess, Holt. Von Kruger is not a man to trust secrets to common workmen.
2.760000: You have been closer to him than most.
1.120000: Where is he now?
1.240000: ..
3.380000: Hesitating, he has a safe house, in Limehouse, by the river.
1.900000: What if I tell you more? I'm a dead man.
2.640000: You are already in peril, Holt.
3.180000: Better to stand with us than against us.
4.680000: Holmes' words, spoken in that quiet yet commanding tone of his,
2.190000: seemed to strike Holt with irresistible force.
3.880000: The man buried his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.
1.950000: Holmes, the fellow is undone.
2.680000: Precisely as intended, Watson
2.100000: Fear has loosened his tongue
1.940000: He will give us what we require
1.560000: And so it proved
2.160000: When Sobs, Hood confessed that Von Kruger
1.960000: Had arranged to leave London by packet boat
2.360000: Within three days, carrying with him the cipher codes
1.020000: And other intelligence
2.820000: Any odd other intelligence, any odd thing throws
1.400000: The Limehouse safe house
1.640000: Was his base until departure
2.900000: Then we must act at once
0.640000: Mr. Holmes
1.880000: If he escapes with those codes
8.470000: He shall not escape, Mr. Phelps. The matter is in hand, but secrecy is barramount.
8.380000: Scotland Yard must not be involved until we have evidence so overwhelming that Von Kruger cannot wriggle free.
4.420000: Lestrade is an able man, but subtlety is not his forte.
3.270000: Then you intend that we ourselves should confront him?
5.700000: We, Watson, and Mr. Holt here, who will guide us?
2.950000: His usefulness has not ended yet.
1.690000: You would march me to my doom.
1.340000: ..
3.420000: Not so. You shall march to your redemption.
3.890000: Assist us, and you may yet earn clemency.
2.790000: Fuse, and I wash my hands of you.
2.140000: Holt droned, but at last nodded.
3.740000: The die was cast. Holmes then turned his keen gaze upon Mr. Phelps.
4.320000: As for you, sir, you must remain hidden.
7.400000: Should word reach Von Kruger that his stratagem has failed, he may seek to silence you outright.
5.460000: Watson and I will face the danger. Your duty is to survive it.
1.040000: ..
4.200000: I can but obey, though it grieves me to be idle while you hazard your lives.
9.800000: Not idle, Mr. Feltz. You shall keep the suitcase under watch. Its contents are the bait, and Von Gruger may yet attempt to reclaim them.
20.200000: .....................
3.300000: At last we reached a row of warehouses by the river.
2.700000: Their windows dark, their walls streaked with soot.
3.390000: Holt led us to a narrow door, half hidden between two structures.
3.500000: He whispered that within lay Von Kruger's refuge.
4.010000: Holmes pressed his ear to the wood, then signals me to ready my revolver.
1.930000: He is within.
4.050000: I hear the creak of boards, the rustle of papers.
1.930000: Steady now, Watson.
1.370000: We go in together.
5.230000: The sudden thrust, Holmes pushed open the door and we burst into the dim interior.
6.500000: A single lamp burned upon a desk, where a tall man with an iron-gray beard sat bent over a pile of documents.
4.410000: He sprang up at our entry, revealing a heavy cane upon which he leaned.
6.020000: His limp was unmistakable. His eyes flashed with fury as he recognized Holt at our side.
2.770000: Traitor! You have led them here!
2.430000: Her, von Kruger, I believe.
2.680000: You will not leave this room with those papers.
1.240000: ..
1.310000: Foolish Englishman,
3.280000: do you think you can bar the will of the Kaiser's service?
3.850000: I think I can bar the will of any man
3.530000: who sets foot in London to sow treachery.
2.670000: Watson, guard the door.
3.150000: The confrontation had reached its climax.
2.640000: Von Kruger's hand darted toward a drawer,
1.090000: but Holmes was quicker.
4.720000: In an instant, he had seized the German by the wrist and wrenched the cane from his grasp.
1.630000: Corpse scattered across the floor.
3.560000: Hodge cowered in the corner while I leveled my revolver at the scene.
2.310000: Move again, sir, and I fire.
2.880000: You have not won yet. There are others.
1.140000: ..
4.400000: Perhaps. But tonight, Herr von Kruger, the game is lost.
1.020000: ..
1.320000: And thus part four closed.
3.370000: With the notorious agent cornered, the stolen code scattered at his feet,
2.570000: and the fate of nations trembling in the balance.
6.560000: The scene in that dim limehouse warehouse remains etched upon my memory with peculiar vividness.
3.040000: The flickering lamp cast distorted shadows upon the walls,
2.560000: the papers of state lay strewn across the floor,
3.570000: and Her von Kruger stood, a snarling embodiment of defiance,
3.390000: restrained only by Holmes' iron grip upon his wrist.
3.080000: Holt whimpered in the corner, and I kept my revolver steady,
2.080000: though my hand trembled with the weight of the moment.
2.040000: ...
2.000000: Enough theatrics, Herr von Kruger.
6.010000: You are caught in the act, and there will be no convenient escape through law or loophole.
2.000000: The stolen codes are here.
3.890000: Your accomplice has confessed, and your limp betrays you,
2.460000: as the figure observed at King's Cross.
2.380000: The web is woven tight.
2.870000: You think your petty deductions will save England?
3.280000: For every agent you catch, ten more arise.
2.430000: The suitcase was but one instrument among many.
9.060000: perhaps yet even the mightiest machine fails when a single cog is removed tonight sir you are that
6.540000: cog von kruger struggled fiercely but holmes's grasp was unyielding at length the man sagged
7.480000: his fury giving way to resignation holmes shall i summon the yard presently watson but first we
6.200000: must gather every scrap of evidence von kruger sit you will dictate an account of your dealings
7.620000: with Mr. Holt and you will sign it. You expect me to write my own condemnation? I expect you
8.520000: to calculate. Refuse and you face charges of espionage, forgery and theft. Comply and perhaps
6.880000: diplomacy will temper justice with mercy. With a muttered curse, the German seated himself at
5.220000: the desk. Holmes placed pen and paper before him and paper before him. Reluctantly, he began to
4.870000: crawl, his heavy hand moving in jagged strokes. Weighe wrote, Holmes, turn to me.
5.670000: Sen, note the ingenuity of the scheme. By placing the suitcase in Phelps's hands,
6.560000: von Kruger ensured that suspicion would fall upon an innocent. The glow was not mere theatrics.
5.700000: It was a signal, visible from the street, to confirm to his watchers that the bait had been
5.420000: accepted. And had we not intervened, Schill, Phelps would have been denounced as traitor
2.420000: when the codes were discovered in his possession?
1.240000: Precisely.
3.690000: The most effective traps are those which require no lies,
1.130000: only appearances.
1.160000: ..
2.320000: Von Kruger completed his reluctant confession,
1.880000: signed it with a flourish of contempt,
3.110000: and cast the pen aside.
1.480000: Holmes gathered the papers,
1.110000: folded them neatly,
1.580000: and secured them within his pocket.
1.200000: ..
0.920000: Excellent.
1.530000: And now, Watson,
2.900000: kindly escort our prisoner to the yard.
4.250000: Inspector Lestrade will be in want of a feather for his cap.
2.090000: You do not accompany us, Holmes?
3.210000: Sidi, no, my dear fellow.
3.360000: I have yet one last visit to make, too.
3.440000: Reassure our unfortunate client and to restore to the Foreign Office
1.970000: what is rightfully theirs.
3.200000: Go on, Watson. I shall rejoin you anon.
2.930000: And so it was that I, with holds shuffling ahead
1.820000: and Von Truger glowering behind,
3.560000: Conveyed our captives through the foggy streets to Scotland Yard
3.420000: Lestrade received them with astonishment not unmixed with ye
3.180000: For to net so prominent an agent was a triumph indeed
2.220000: By the time I returned to Baker Street
2.600000: Holmes had already concluded his arrangements with Feds
2.560000: The suitcase, stripped of its sinister contents
1.900000: Sat innocently upon the heart-drug
3.460000: No longer glowing but seeming almost embarrassed by its notoriety
3.340000: Mr. Holmes, I am in your debt beyond words
3.160000: My honour is preserved, my career rescued from ruin
1.880000: How may I repay you?
6.150000: By forgetting this affair ever occurred, Mr Phelps, silence is your safeguard.
7.220000: The fewer who know how close England came to betrayal, the stronger her position remains.
4.970000: Then I shall speak of it to no one, but permit me to grasp your hand in gratitude.
1.100000: ..
7.560000: Very good. Now return to your duties with renewed vigour and let the shadow of this episode fade.
4.640000: With tears in his eyes, Phelps departed. Holmes sank into his armchair,
4.000000: steepled his fingers, and closed his eyes. I watched him for some moments before my
6.000000: curiosity overcame restraint. Holmes, I must beg you, explain to me fully how you unraveled this
3.760000: enigma, for though I followed your steps, much still eludes me.
7.440000: Very well, Watson. You recall the beginning, the suitcase thrust into Phelps' hands by a cabman.
2.300000: The first deduction was elementary.
3.980000: The cabman was no cabman at all, but an accomplice.
6.000000: His limp identified him later as von Kruger himself.
2.150000: But why risk appearing in person?
3.300000: Because trust is rare among conspirators.
3.860000: Von Kruger would place the evidence only with his own hand.
2.880000: He calculated that a humble clerk,
4.130000: confused by the sudden burden, would carry it home unexamined.
2.430000: And the deal?
3.430000: A masterpiece of intimidation
3.460000: Most men confronted with such unnatural light
1.940000: would fear to touch the object
1.800000: It kept Phelps at bay
2.820000: until discovery could be contrived
3.800000: Moreover, it served as signal to watchers outside
3.380000: The device was Holt's work as you saw
3.480000: You perceived his hand in it from the first?
1.220000: Indeed
7.980000: The phosphorescent residue upon the suitcase handle was of a compound rare outside Holt's shop.
5.690000: I confirmed it by spectral analysis before we confronted him.
3.940000: And the weight of the case led you to suspect concealed apparatus?
5.000000: Exactly. Documents alone could not account for such heaviness.
3.670000: The coil and batteries explained it perfectly.
3.620000: Your patience in waiting three days before opening the lock
5.170000: was that to test whether the door was ha-ha-ha, hmm, RM-ful, hmm.
6.980000: Just so. Never meddle with an unknown device until you have examined it from every angle.
5.050000: Too many detectives, Watson, rush to the dramatic and perish in the attempt.
3.690000: Science first, action after.
4.590000: He spoke with such calm certainty that I could not but marvel anew at his method,

5.760000: When Holt hesitated, I supplied the answer, and he confirmed it.
1.780000: And now the affair is ended?

2.960000: It was a fleeting glimpse, but one I treasured.
2.620000: Thus ended the strange adventure of the glowing suitcase,
3.400000: a tale of treachery and cunning, of science twisted to dark ends,
3.140000: and of one man's unfoldering genius which turned the tide.
2.180000: Many more cases awaited us in the years to come,
