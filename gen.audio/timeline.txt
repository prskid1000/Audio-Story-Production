4.040: It is with a peculiar thrill that I commit to paper the strange circumstances
2.110: surrounding what has, see,
4.450: are made to be known in certain musical circles as the song of the vanishing piano.
3.000: Few events in my long acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes
3.710: demonstrated with such clarity his uncanny method of deduction,
4.130: and few occasions showed more plainly how my own role as humble chronicler
4.740: and fateful companion provided both contrast and completion to that singular intellect.
3.540: The affair began upon one of those damp and sooty evenings in London
3.160: when the fog seems to press against the windows of Baker Street
2.890: like a half-conscious spirit demanding admittance.
2.070: The gas lamps flickered in a haze
2.860: and the sound of carriage wheels outside came muffled
2.530: as if London itself were wrapped in cotton.
2.850: Holmes had spent much of the day silent and restless,
3.850: stretched upon the settee with his long fingers interlaced beneath his chin.
3.290: A familiar sign that his mind was engaged upon some abstract speculation
2.180: had been attempting to digest the medical journal.
3.000: Though truthfully I had read the same page three times without comprehension,
3.110: distracted by the intense stillness of my companion.
4.590: My dear Holmes, you have been staring at that ceiling for the better part of the afternoon.
5.940: I cannot but conclude that some case or perhaps the want of one has occupied your thoughts.
6.440: Elementary Watson, I am, as you say, occupied, but by absence rather than presence.
5.060: You will observe that the calling card tray upon our mantel is empty and misses.
8.790: Hudson has twice informed us that no visitor has rung at our bell.
5.770: For three days the stream of human problems has dried to a trickle.
5.760: The city of London has, quite inconsiderately, ceased to be interesting.
1.690: You astonish me, Holmes.
5.170: Surely the metropolis of severed millions cannot fail to supply intrigue and rhyme even for a single evening.
4.280: On the contrary, my dear fellow, it can.
6.030: The criminal class is as subject to fatigue as any honest labourer.
4.190: One may as well expect perpetual harvest as perpetual villainy.
5.990: But mark me, when the pendulum ceases to swing, it but gathers force to strike again.
4.630: I predict that before the night is out, Baker Street will not be so quiet.
5.500: It was as if the great detective had summoned destiny with his words.
3.800: For no sooner had he spoken than there came a sharp rap upon the door,
3.870: followed by Mrs. Zondin Hudson's somewhat breathless voice.
5.750: Mr. Holmes, sir, a gentleman to see you says it is most urgent.
5.360: A moment later, into our sitting room stepped a tall and somewhat cadaverous man of middle years,
2.760: dressed in a frock coat that had clearly seen better days,
4.520: and carrying beneath his arm a folio of sheep music so swollen with loose pages
3.370: that it threatened to scatter its contents upon a heart-thrug.
4.380: His expression, pale and strained, betrayed an agitation not far from panic.
2.630: His hair was unkempt, his boots poorly polished,
5.140: yet his fingers were long, delicate and bore the unmistakable calluses of a musician.
3.280: Mr. Sherlock Holmes, thank heaven I have found you.
3.240: My name is Arthur Penfield, late of the Royal Academy of Music.
5.120: I implore you, sir, to hear my case, but I am on the verge of ruin.
2.960: You are most welcome, Mr. Penfield.
1.320: Pray be seated.
3.510: You will find the chair by the fire the most comfortable.
3.170: Allow me to relieve you of your folio.
6.550: Ah, I perceive it concerns a pianoforte composition, written in your own hand.
3.050: You are correct, sir, though I marvel how you knew it.
9.120: elementary the ink stains upon your right cuff match precisely the fresh notation on the uppermost
7.020: leaf the nervous tremor in your left hand is not congenital but the result of recent over practice
7.560: upon the keys and your manner of carrying the folio clutched not as an idle portfolio but as a
4.080: Mother clutches a child, speaks of personal authorship.
4.850: The poor man gazed at Holmes with wide eyes, as though confronted by a sorcerer.
3.550: Then you will understand, sir, how desperate is my plight.
7.370: I have written, nay, I had written, a composition intended for public premiere at St. James's Hall next week.
2.630: It was to be my redemption, my masterwork.
4.720: But last night, in the valley jamo where I lodged, the instrument upon which I composed,
6.720: the pianoforte itself vanished utterly. Vanished, sir, as though the very air had swallowed it.
5.150: Vanished? Surely you mean stolen, or removed by porters during your absence?
5.650: Would that it was so simple, doctor, but I swear to you, and to Mr. Mr. Holmes,
5.480: that the pianoforte disappeared whilst I sat before it. I had just completed the central
6.260: motif of the second movement when, upon striking the keys, I heard no sound, nothing but silence.
6.180: I looked down and the keyboard was gone. The lid, the frame, the sounding board all were gone.
6.100: I sat with my hands upon empty air. Only the bench remained beneath me.
6.680: Holmes, who had been listening with eyes half-closed, now leaned forward, every feature alert with interest.
4.220: You say the piano vanished while you were in the act of playing it?
7.950: You perceived no human agency, no movers, no trick of carpentry, no trap-door?
5.270: None, sir. My lodgings are on the third floor of a boarding-house in Bloomsbury.
8.630: The door was locked, the window shut, and yet the instrument, an upright pianoforte of German make, ceased to exist before my eyes.
6.210: My dear Holmes, surely this is a delusion. Our visitor was overwrought, fatigued perhaps from labour at his art.
4.240: I myself, in medical practice, have known patients who...
4.150: Hush, Watson. Let us never mistake the improbable for the impossible.
5.640: Our client's senses may have deceived him, but we must not permit our reason to do the same.
0.780: Ah!
4.880: Pay continue, Mr. Penfield. Did you at once search the chamber?
5.530: Indeed I did, sir. I examined every corner, opened the wardrobe, even peered beneath the bed,
2.780: as if a pianoforte might conceal itself there.
2.620: Neighbours heard my outcry and came running.
1.590: They too saw the room,
3.220: bare save for the stool and the folio upon it.
1.610: My landlady insists.
1.580: I have gone mad.
1.380: But I swear to you, mister.
0.740: Mister!
4.240: Holmes, the piano was there one instant and gone the next.
3.240: And the sheet music you carry,
4.140: this was composed upon that same vanished instrument.
1.590: Yes, sir.
2.490: Every note of it, without the instrument,
3.250: I cannot refine the piece, nor can I rehearse.
3.910: My reputation and my livelihood both depend upon the concert.
3.390: Unless I recover the piano forte, or at the very least,
3.400: solve the riddle of its disappearance, I am undone.
5.060: Holmes rose and paced the room, his long strides carrying him from heart to window and back again.
3.710: He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then turned to me with a glint in his eye.
4.350: Watson, you recall my remark, not ten minutes past,
2.860: that Baker Street would not remain quiet tonight?
2.780: The game, it seems, has begun.
2.010: A vanishing piano, Watson.
2.620: Have you ever heard of such a marvel?
1.290: Never, Holmes.
3.920: And I confess, I still struggle to believe it possible.
5.760: That is because you rely upon probability rather than possibility.
3.830: The improbable, my dear friend, happens daily.
4.960: It is only the impossible that remains forever barred.
4.590: Let us then ascertain whether Mr. Sin, whether Mr.
4.850: Penfield's pianoforte is improbable or impossible.
5.170: Mr. Penfield, you must take us to your lodgings at once.
5.130: With all my heart, sir, I have prayed for nothing, so much as your assistance.
2.850: But I warn you, the landlady is hostile.
3.510: She believes me deranged and would prefer the matter hushed up.
9.740: So much the better. Opposition sharpens the wits. Watson, your hat and coat. We go to Bloomsbury.
20.260: ...........
4.000: Penfield clutched his photo upon his lap as though it were life itself.
5.000: I, for my part, could not dispel the image of a piano vanishing before the eyes of its player.
4.000: The city seemed to close in around us, whispering of secrets hidden in shadow,
4.000: as we drove towards the first act of a most singular mystery.
5.000: The descent into the lower rooms of Mrs. Gaskill's boarding house was accomplished
4.000: with much creaking of timbers and muttered protests from the landlady,
3.000: who had reappeared upon hearing our footsteps.
4.170: The candlelight trembled against wallpaper, already blistered with damp,
3.380: and the air drew close with the odor of boiled cabbage and cold smoke.
1.410: Hmm, Mr. Hmm.
4.430: Hemphine followed like a man condemned, clutching his folio tightly against his dress,
2.860: while Holmes moved ahead with swift, noiseless tread,
3.030: pausing at every landing to examine the walls, the banisters,
2.710: the very nails that held the carpet runner in place.
3.390: Watson, observe the spacing of these boards.
3.590: They are old oak, but recently disturbed.
3.600: Note the faint discolouration along the edges.
4.900: Something has been lifted here and replaced within the last month.
2.720: Yes, Holmes, I see the difference in you,
2.900: though I should have walked past without remarking it.
1.440: Precisely.
3.710: The criminal counts upon the public's blindness to detail.
3.730: To the trained eye, however, each grain of wood is a witness.
3.470: Now let us inquire of Mrs. Gaskell.
2.560: If you're meaning the floor, sir,
2.370: it was repaired a fortnight ago.
4.110: My second-floor lodger complained of drafts.
3.960: A carpenter from Holborn came to lay new planks.
2.360: Hey, just so.
2.910: And what was the name of this carpenter?
1.470: I couldn't tell you.
2.200: Some tall fellow with a red beard.
3.710: I paid him in coin and thought no more about it.
1.280: A pity.
3.990: Yet red beards like pianos cannot vanish without trace.
2.080: Watson, make a note of it
5.140: Now, let us see what lies immediately beneath Mr. Penfew's chamber
3.760: We entered the second floor room, which was at present unoccupied
3.840: Its bed stripped bare, its furniture cloaked in dust sheets
3.100: Holmes paced to the centre of the floor and tapped with his cane
3.660: producing a hollow resonance unlike the solid tone one would expect
2.440: He dropped to one knee, pressed his ear against the boards
1.960: and then smiled in quiet satisfaction
3.000: There, Watson, do you not hear it?
6.180: A cavity beneath, large enough, I dare say, to swallow more than draughts, large enough,
2.700: perhaps, for an entire piano forte.
1.710: A hidden chamber?
2.790: Then the piano may not have left the house at all.
1.410: Exactly.
7.150: Now, the question remains, by what mechanism was it lowered from above without Mr. Penfield
1.940: perceiving the transition?
1.640: Lowered, sir?
1.460: You astonish me.
2.610: Surely I would have fez the descent beneath me.
1.690: Would you?
2.100: ..
4.900: Consider, the player is absorbed in his art,
4.930: his mind fixed upon the score, his hands occupied upon the keys.
4.170: If the entire floor beneath the instrument descended slowly,
3.440: by counterweight, perhaps, or hydraulic piston,
3.070: you might experience only a curious vibration,
3.750: such as you described, a hum beneath the floorboards.
0.760: Oh!
2.160: ..
1.320: Thumbs' words struck me
1.540: with the force of revelation.
2.800: The notion of an entire piano
2.140: being swallowed by the earth seemed wild
2.180: and yet the hollow echo of the boards
1.160: lent it credence.
1.720: My friend's eyes shone with excitement
2.380: like a scientist on the brink of discovery.
3.270: Watson, fetch that poker from the fireplace.
2.880: We shall test these boards for weakness.
1.750: I complied
2.680: and together we prized up a length of flooring.
1.100: Beneath lay darkness
4.940: But as Holmes lowered the candle into the aperture, the flickering light revealed an astonishing sight.
4.840: A shaft descending into the depths of the house, lined with wooden beams and fitted with ropes and pulleys.
6.750: At the bottom, far below, we glimpsed the curved outline of what could only be a piano, resting silently in the gloom.
3.160: Good heavens, there it is, the instrument itself.
3.000: Merciful Providence, my piano.
3.010: So much for vanishing into thin air.
7.290: The trick, Watson, is as old as a stage, a trap door, ingeniously concealed,
4.360: through which the entire pianoforte has been lowered.
3.090: The hum.
3.980: Penfield heard was the sound of machinery.
2.300: The question is, why?
3.000: ..
3.180: With Holmes's guidance, we descended to the ground floor,
3.020: where a locked door barred our way to the cellars.
5.380: Mrs. Gaskell, though reluctant, produced a key muttering of nonsense and foolishness.
4.040: Within, we found a cavernous space, its walls lined with coal and firewood,
4.110: but in the centre stood a wooden platform connected to ropes, wheels and counterweights.
6.620: On that platform, like some sacrificial idol, rested the pianoforte, unscathed but eerily silent.
2.010: There you have it, Watson.
6.390: a perfectly contrived stage elevator concealed within a humble boarding house.
6.300: Such craftsmanship bespeaks not a common carpenter, but a mechanic of considerable skill.
4.050: See the polish of the wheels, the precision of the grooves.
3.270: This is the work of a master.
4.880: But to what end? Why lower a piano into the cellars beneath its owner's nose?
3.350: That, my dear fellow, is the heart of the mystery.
2.580: Peft is the obvious explanation
3.040: Yet the instrument remains here untouched
1.910: Sabotage?
1.150: Perhaps
2.560: Or perhaps something more elaborate
2.880: Something that concerns not the piano itself
1.880: But the music it bears
2.040: You bewilder me, sir
2.370: Who would wish to sabotage my work?
2.710: I am no celebrity, only a struggling composer
5.060: And yet, Mr. Penfield
5.860: Even a struggling composer may stumble upon a melody others desire to suppress.
4.400: Tell me, your composition, does it borrow from any source,
4.100: any folk song, any secret theme entrusted to you?
4.150: None, sir. The music is wholly my own, though.
2.950: Hmm. Though what? Hmm.
3.910: There is one peculiarity. The central motif came to me in a dream.
2.290: I awoke with it ringing in my ears,
3.520: as though some unseen musician had played it to me in the night.
4.600: I wrote it down at once, and it has since become the very soul of my concerto.
3.230: Holmes's brows knitted, and he muttered half to himself,
4.660: A melody in a dream, a piano swallowed by machinery,
3.060: a brass fragment that does not belong.
4.070: Watson, we are upon the edge of something curious indeed.
4.080: Mark me, this affair reaches deeper than Bloomsbury.
5.060: I must know who built this contrivance and for whose hand.
2.390: Then you suspect a conspiracy?
6.410: I suspect only that human ingenuity rarely expends itself without motive.
5.370: Somewhere in London is a man with a red beard and a talent for hidden machinery.
3.490: Find him, Watson, and we find our truth.
5.980: Meanwhile, Mr. Penfield, I urge you to guard your score most carefully.
7.130: For if your enemies cannot steal your piano, they may attempt to steal the song itself.
6.230: At that moment, a distant bell tolled the hour, its mournfully clang echoing through the cellar like a warning.
2.990: Holmes extinguished the candle and straightened to his full height.
3.960: His face was grave, yet his eyes glittered with anticipation.
3.680: Come, gentlemen, we have seen enough for tonight.
3.190: Tomorrow we hunt the man with the red beard.
4.640: Thus ended the first stage of our adventure.
2.530: A piano found, yet the riddle deepened,
2.640: a mystery solved, yet a greater enigma born.
3.070: I could not then imagine how perilous our quest would become,
2.980: nor how the song itself would draw us into a web of intrigue
2.510: that reached far beyond the walls of Bloomsbury.
2.810: When morning broke over Baker Street the following day,
3.160: the fog had lifted, and Mazel, the air still hung heavy
2.370: with the acrid smoke of a thousand chimneys.
2.530: Holmes had risen before me, as was often his custom,
4.380: and when I emerged from my room, I found him already at the table with maps, directories
3.350: and his chemical apparatus scattered around him in chaotic order.
2.450: He had exchanged his dressing gown for a tweed suit
5.030: and the energy in his movements told me that his mind had raced far into the mystery during the night.
4.140: Holmes, you look as though you have already solved the case before breakfast.
2.100: Not solved, Watson.
3.090: Merely sharpened the tools with which to cut.
3.160: We are in pursuit of a red-bearded mechanic,
7.220: a craftsman of no mean ability, who installed a trap capable of lowering an entire pianoforte
7.520: into the bowels of a Broomsbury boarding-house. Such a man cannot be common. London swarms with
5.850: tinkers and carpenters, but few who could accomplish such engineering in secrecy.
5.670: Therefore he must be known in certain circles. And how do you propose to find him?
4.980: By the oldest method of all, my dear fellow, inquiry,
5.380: I have already dispatched young Wiggins and his Baker Street irregulars
3.770: to gorm the workshops of Holborn and Clerkenwell.
2.780: A red-beard Watson is a beacon.
2.860: With luck, by noon we shall have a name.
2.890: As if on cue, there came a tapping at the door,
2.620: and in shuffle Wiggins, the street urchin,
3.880: whose quick eyes and nimble feet had served us in many an adventure,
3.450: He removed his cap and spoke with his usual bluntness.
1.960: Beg pardon, Mr. Holmes.
1.080: We found dine.
3.800: Name, oh Ezekiel Trenchard, keeps a whisk shop off Leather Lane.
3.140: Folks call him Red Zeke on account of the whiskers.
1.620: Bids are contraptions.
3.810: Stage rigs, hidden doors, trap mechanisms for them, theaters.
3.610: Got a reputation for being clever, but not over-scrupulous.
1.540: Excellent, Wiggins.
3.430: You and your lads have earned your shillings handsomely.
4.710: Here, take this coin and keep watch upon Mr. Trenchard's premises.
2.520: Report to me, any visitor of note.
3.720: Listen, we go at once to Leather Lane.
3.390: Soon we were rattling through the crowded streets in a cab,
1.470: home silent and intent.
2.250: I armed with my revolver by long habit,
2.130: though half convinced it would not be needed.
2.230: Leather Lane proved a narrow thoroughfare
2.920: cluttered with coast among us guards and shouting hawkers.
1.940: At its far end we found the place,
2.640: a grimy workshop with windows thick with soot,
4.590: and above the door, a fading sign, E. Plenchard, Engineer of Mechanisms.
6.570: Observe, Watson, the iron filings upon the sill, the heavy crates by the entrance.
4.930: Business here is active, though the sign suggests disuse.
3.480: Consumment in plain sight, as ever.
3.450: We entered and were met with a curious sight.
2.300: The interior resembled a magician's storeroom.
3.960: Wheels, pulleys, counterweights, and elaborate frames crowded every surface.
6.130: At the far bench, bending over a set of blueprints, stood a broad-shouldered man with a mane of flaming beard.
2.800: He straightened, eyes narrowing at our intrusion.
4.720: Who are ye and what's your business in Ezekiel Trenchard's shop?
5.590: Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and this is my colleague, Dr. Watson.
8.420: We come regarding a certain Ganoforte, lowered into a cellar by means of a trap you constructed in a Bloomsbury house.
3.270: So, the trap worked, eh?
2.100: Ha! I told him it would.
2.530: Smooth as silk, down she goes.
2.560: But what business is that of yours?
3.030: The business of justice, Mr. Trenchard.
3.380: You were hired by someone to create this contrivance.
2.170: I must know who.
1.950: Now, why should I tell you?
2.630: My clients pay well for silence.
4.060: Because your client intends more than theatrics.
7.240: and you may find yourself accessory to a crime far darker than mere carpentry.
2.170: Consider carefully, Mr. Trenchard.
4.790: The law makes no distinction between the man who builds the pistol
3.620: and the man who pulls the trigger.
6.010: The mechanic's ruddy face paled somewhat, though his eyes still glittered with defiance.
4.650: I was paid in sovereigns to build a stage lift, not to ask questions.
1.910: But, well, I'll tell you this much.
2.560: The man who hired me called himself Mr. Green.
3.560: Thin fellow. Foreign accent. Eyes sharp as knives.
2.880: He brought sketches. Knew what he wanted.
2.950: Paid half in advance, half on completion.
1.610: That's all I know.
2.310: A foreign accent, you say?
2.710: Could you identify his nationality?
2.560: German, maybe. Or Austrian.
2.530: Something from the continent, that's sure.
2.580: Indeed. And this Mr. Green?
3.480: did he mention why he required the piano to vanish?
1.800: Not in so many words.
1.810: Only said the music was dangerous,
2.710: that it must be silenced before it was heard.
3.020: I thought him cracked, but his money was sound.
1.440: Dangerous music.
0.670: Ha!
1.990: Holmes exchanged a glance with me,
2.170: his brows lifting in silent emphasis.
1.550: Dangerous music!
2.750: The phrase struck a chord of unease within me.
3.830: Holmes, surely he does not mean that Mr. Penfield's composition holds some secret?
12.180: It seems increasingly probable, Watson. Music may convey more than melody. Codes, signals, even mathematical formulae can be embedded within notes.
3.820: Mr. Trenchard! Did Mr. Trenchard!
4.480: Green, give any instruction beyond the trap's construction?
8.060: Only this, that once the piano was lowered, it must remain below until he returned with men to fetch it away.
3.470: I asked when that might be, but he only laughed and said,
2.150: when the last note is played.
2.130: A curious phrase indeed.
2.410: Very well, Mr. Gaines.
4.920: Trenchard, you have been frank, and I shall not press you further.
1.420: But take warning.
4.360: If harm comes of this scheme, your name will not be spared.
1.320: Good day.
3.550: With that, Owens turned upon his heel and strode into the street,
2.130: leaving the mechanic to mutter among his gears.
2.040: I hurried after him, bewildered.
5.430: Holmes, what can it mean? Dangerous musics? Surely a tune is but a tune.
3.570: Do not underestimate the subtle arts, Watson.
6.330: Consider the ancients who believed music could stir armies or calm tempests.
4.620: Consider the mathematician who may encode a cipher within notes.
4.930: Suppose, mister, Penfield's melody, born in a dream, he says,
3.320: contains a secret intended never to be revealed.
5.120: But revealed by whom?
4.140: That, my dear fellow, is what we must discover.
2.830: Come, we return to Bigger Street.
2.620: There is research to be done.
4.240: Back at our lodgings, Holmes immersed himself in his volumes of arcane knowledge.
3.810: He rifled through treatises on cryptography, histories of secret societies,
2.640: and even monographs upon the psychology of music.
2.660: All afternoon he pored over staves and scales,
3.900: humming fragments of Penfield's score that the composer had left with us.
3.760: At last, as twilight fell, he sprang up with a cry of triumph.
3.450: Watson, it is as I suspected.
2.160: The motif concedes a code.
0.870: Look here.
2.240: Take the first note of each bar.
3.240: Convert its pitch to a letter by simple substitution.
1.750: And what do you read?
4.740: I bent over the paper, and slowly the letters resolved themselves into words.
1.490: My heart gave a leap.
1.620: Oh, the key lies in Vienna.
2.480: Good heavens, Holmes, it is a message.
5.220: Precisely. And not merely a message, but a directive.
5.280: Someone has planted within Penfield's dream a melody
4.780: which conceals the command to seek a key in Vienna.
2.910: The question is, who and why?
2.660: At that instant, a knock rattled the door.
2.520: Mrs. Hudson entered, pale and trembling.
3.610: Mr. Holmes, there's a gentleman below asking for you.
6.010: says his name is Green. Will you see him? Holmes's eyes flashed. He reached for his violin,
4.670: set it upon the table as though it were a weapon and whispered to me in urgent tones.
5.300: The game quickens, Watson. Mr. Green has come to us of his own accord.
5.780: Ready yourself. We may at last confront the mind behind the vanishing piano.
5.660: The fire burned low in our Baker Street sitting room, casting long flickering shadows against
6.360: the bookshelves and the framed Persian slipper on the mantle. Mrs. Hudson had scarcely finished
4.300: announcing the visitor when the man himself entered, and I confess my blood chilled at the
5.860: sight. He was tall, gaunt, with the pallor of one who lived more in lamplight than under the sun.
4.200: He was trim-close, his hair slick-bat with continental precision, but it was his eyes
6.080: that arrested me, icy-gray, piercing, restless, darting from Holmes to myself and back again
2.180: with the vigilance of a predator.
3.150: Herr Holmes, said he in a voice soft yet cutting,
1.780: and Dr. Watson, ja?
3.780: So the hounds have scented me sooner than I expected.
3.600: Mr. Green, or should I say Herr Grun,
2.220: Austrian, perhaps Prussian,
1.910: certainly of the German tongue,
4.490: you honour us by stepping into our den voluntarily.
2.280: May I offer you a chair?
2.440: Your courtesy is wasted, sir.
1.350: I came not for tea,
4.940: but to reclaim what is mine, the piano, and the melody that resided in it.
2.490: You have interfered sufficiently.
2.800: Yours? The piano belongs to Mr. Mr.
4.330: Dild, Enfield, a humble composer who never sought entanglement with espionage.
2.310: Tote dows it to being biny, this.
3.480: Ah, poor Penfield, a vessel only, not the source.
4.380: He dreamed the melody because it was planted in him.
2.150: A modic suggestion, gentlemen.
4.490: We of the continent have studied such arts deeply.
4.990: In a moment between waking and sleep, we gave him the theme, never knowing if it would blossom.
3.290: It did, and it contained more than music.
5.350: A cipher encoding the phrase, the key lies in Vienna.
3.060: We have already deciphered it, Herr Grun.
3.620: But tell me, what key and why Vienna?
2.200: You are clever, Holmes, but not omniscient.
5.460: omniscient. The melody concealed the location of a document, an agreement signed secretly between
5.380: two empires that could plunge Europe into chaos if revealed. The piano was to vanish until we
6.640: might transport it safely abroad. But you, you have meddled. His voice rose and for a moment
4.680: the mask of control slipped, revealing the fanatic beneath. Holmes, however, remained
4.240: unruffled, tapping his long fingers together as though playing an invisible clavier.
3.440: Your plan was ingenious, I grant you
2.840: To hide a cipher within a tune
2.840: Entrusted to a dreamer who believed it
2.600: His own composition, admirable
2.900: But you erred in one respect
2.700: And that is?
2.700: In thinking that London
3.600: The city with eyes and ears in every alley
4.560: Would allow a foreign agent to burrow unseen
4.920: Your red-bearded accomplice betrayed you by his very uniqueness
4.060: and your arrogance brought you to my doorstep.
2.300: Groom's hand twitched toward his coat pocket,
3.920: but quicker than thought Holmes had drawn the revolver he seldom carried,
1.890: save at direst need.
2.510: How do not, Herr Groom?
2.680: My friend Watson also carries an arm,
6.080: and unlike myself he has spent service years firing it in earnest.
4.790: Track and indeed sir, I said firmly, though my heart pounded.
1.470: Smiling thinly.
2.800: So, you have me tracked, but what will you do, Holmes?
1.160: Turn me to Skarnanyard?
3.130: They will not grasp the significance of what I bear.
2.200: The melody is still in my mind.
5.110: The key remains hidden in Vienna, awaiting only the one who can read the notes.
5.680: Your mind perhaps, but music may be copied, analysed, destroyed.
7.500: The tomb lies also with me now, and I have no intention of allowing it into careless hands.
9.000: As for you, Lestrade shall know what to do with an agent of espionage who traffics in stolen secrets.
7.500: At that moment, heavy boots slattered upon the stairs, and Inspector Lestrade himself burst into the room, breathless but resolute.
3.000: Horns, it seemed, had sent a telegram earlier in the day.
5.740: Holmes, Watson, I came as quick as I could, and this, I take it, is our quarry.
8.280: Indeed, Lestrade. Herr Grün, alias Mr. Green, foreign agent, mastermind of the vanishing piano.
3.540: Hmm, he is yours. Hmm.
5.050: Bitterly, so the curtain falls. But mark me, Holmes, the play is not ended.
3.450: Vienna will yet sing, and when she does, Europe shall tremble.
5.200: With iron restraint, Lestrade's men clapped irons upon the spy and bore him,
1.070: struggling down the stairs.
4.620: The echoes of his threats lingered in the room long after his footsteps had faded.
2.700: The days that followed were filled with inquiry.
4.610: The Foreign Office, apprised of the matter, hushed the affair with typical discretion,
4.330: whispering only of continental intrigues and tanking Holmes in guarded phrases.
4.230: Mr. Herm, Penfield the composer, was released from suspicion,
5.270: though he vowed never again to trust a melody that arrived unbidden in his dreams.
3.640: Horns, I said one evening, as we sat once more by our fire.
2.690: I cannot shake the unease that blings to this case.
2.700: A melody planted like a parasite in the mind,
1.620: a piano swallowed by the earth,
3.290: and a spy who claims that the fate of Europe rests upon a tune.
2.040: It all seems scarcely credible.
2.460: Yet credible it is, Watson.
3.380: Men will go to astounding lengths for power.
3.080: Today it is ink upon a treaty.
3.770: Tomorrow, it may be a code hidden in music.
2.820: The human mind is both lock and key,
3.740: and there will always be those who seek to master it.
1.470: But what of the message?
1.370: The key lies in Vienna.
3.090: Have we truly forestalled danger or only delayed it?
3.370: We have struck a blow, not finished the war.
2.920: Another agent may pursue the secret in Vienna,
3.400: but Herr Grün's immediate scheme is ended.
4.320: Our duty lies not in reshaping empires,
4.520: but in defending the innocent who stumble, like Penfield,
2.890: into the path of darker designs.
2.540: I could not argue with this philosophy,
1.730: though it left me with a gnawing sense
3.200: that larger forces moved beyond the grasp of any detective.
2.570: However brilliant, Holmes leaned back,
2.810: his keen profile illuminated by the lamplight,
1.740: and drew his violin from its case.
6.770: Listen, Watson, here is the theme as Penfield dreamed it.
3.890: He played the haunting string, notes rising like ghosts in the air.
5.360: To my ears it was both beautiful and sorrowful, a whisper from some realm beyond reason.
3.790: Yet as Holmes played, I fancied I heard beneath the melody another voice,
3.000: the echo of groom's warning that Vienna would yet sing.
2.920: When the final note faded, Holmes lowered the bow,
3.880: though his eyes, half-closed, betrayed a fatigue deeper than physical.
11.910: it is finished watson for now remember always every tune has its last note the trick is to know when it has truly ended
3.490: And so, continued the affair of the song of the vanishing piano.
5.220: A case unlike any other, where espionage, music and human imagination intertwined.
3.960: To this day, whenever I hear the lonely strains of a violin in the night,
3.170: I recall the vision of that piano sinking into the earth.
3.880: The cry of a spy undone and the figure of Sherlock Holmes declaring,
3.600: with his customary calm, that for him, everything was elementary.
