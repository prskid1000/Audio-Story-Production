4.0: It is with a peculiar thrill that I commit to paper the strange circumstances
2.0: surrounding what has, see,
4.2: are made to be known in certain musical circles as the song of the vanishing piano.
2.8: Few events in my long acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes
3.5: demonstrated with such clarity his uncanny method of deduction,
3.9: and few occasions showed more plainly how my own role as humble chronicler
4.6: and fateful companion provided both contrast and completion to that singular intellect.
3.4: The affair began upon one of those damp and sooty evenings in London
3.2: when the fog seems to press against the windows of Baker Street
2.7: like a half-conscious spirit demanding admittance.
1.8: The gas lamps flickered in a haze
2.9: and the sound of carriage wheels outside came muffled
2.4: as if London itself were wrapped in cotton.
2.6: Holmes had spent much of the day silent and restless,
3.6: stretched upon the settee with his long fingers interlaced beneath his chin.
3.2: A familiar sign that his mind was engaged upon some abstract speculation
2.1: had been attempting to digest the medical journal.
2.9: Though truthfully I had read the same page three times without comprehension,
2.7: distracted by the intense stillness of my companion.
3.9: My dear Holmes, you have been staring at that ceiling for the better part of the afternoon.
5.1: I cannot but conclude that some case or perhaps the want of one has occupied your thoughts.
5.9: Elementary Watson, I am, as you say, occupied, but by absence rather than presence.
5.1: You will observe that the calling card tray upon our mantel is empty and misses.
8.4: Hudson has twice informed us that no visitor has rung at our bell.
5.4: For three days the stream of human problems has dried to a trickle.
5.3: The city of London has, quite inconsiderately, ceased to be interesting.
1.0: You astonish me, Holmes.
5.0: Surely the metropolis of severed millions cannot fail to supply intrigue and rhyme even for a single evening.
4.0: On the contrary, my dear fellow, it can.
5.5: The criminal class is as subject to fatigue as any honest labourer.
3.8: One may as well expect perpetual harvest as perpetual villainy.
5.6: But mark me, when the pendulum ceases to swing, it but gathers force to strike again.
4.4: I predict that before the night is out, Baker Street will not be so quiet.
5.3: It was as if the great detective had summoned destiny with his words.
3.4: For no sooner had he spoken than there came a sharp rap upon the door,
3.3: followed by Mrs. Zondin Hudson's somewhat breathless voice.
4.9: Mr. Holmes, sir, a gentleman to see you says it is most urgent.
4.7: A moment later, into our sitting room stepped a tall and somewhat cadaverous man of middle years,
2.6: dressed in a frock coat that had clearly seen better days,
4.5: and carrying beneath his arm a folio of sheep music so swollen with loose pages
3.3: that it threatened to scatter its contents upon a heart-thrug.
4.1: His expression, pale and strained, betrayed an agitation not far from panic.
2.4: His hair was unkempt, his boots poorly polished,
4.5: yet his fingers were long, delicate and bore the unmistakable calluses of a musician.
2.5: Mr. Sherlock Holmes, thank heaven I have found you.
3.0: My name is Arthur Penfield, late of the Royal Academy of Music.
4.6: I implore you, sir, to hear my case, but I am on the verge of ruin.
2.2: You are most welcome, Mr. Penfield.
0.8: Pray be seated.
3.0: You will find the chair by the fire the most comfortable.
2.6: Allow me to relieve you of your folio.
5.7: Ah, I perceive it concerns a pianoforte composition, written in your own hand.
2.5: You are correct, sir, though I marvel how you knew it.
9.1: elementary the ink stains upon your right cuff match precisely the fresh notation on the uppermost
7.0: leaf the nervous tremor in your left hand is not congenital but the result of recent over practice
7.6: upon the keys and your manner of carrying the folio clutched not as an idle portfolio but as a
3.7: Mother clutches a child, speaks of personal authorship.
4.1: The poor man gazed at Holmes with wide eyes, as though confronted by a sorcerer.
3.2: Then you will understand, sir, how desperate is my plight.
7.2: I have written, nay, I had written, a composition intended for public premiere at St. James's Hall next week.
2.3: It was to be my redemption, my masterwork.
4.5: But last night, in the valley jamo where I lodged, the instrument upon which I composed,
6.4: the pianoforte itself vanished utterly. Vanished, sir, as though the very air had swallowed it.
4.3: Vanished? Surely you mean stolen, or removed by porters during your absence?
5.0: Would that it was so simple, doctor, but I swear to you, and to Mr. Mr. Holmes,
5.3: that the pianoforte disappeared whilst I sat before it. I had just completed the central
6.3: motif of the second movement when, upon striking the keys, I heard no sound, nothing but silence.
6.0: I looked down and the keyboard was gone. The lid, the frame, the sounding board all were gone.
5.5: I sat with my hands upon empty air. Only the bench remained beneath me.
5.9: Holmes, who had been listening with eyes half-closed, now leaned forward, every feature alert with interest.
3.8: You say the piano vanished while you were in the act of playing it?
7.4: You perceived no human agency, no movers, no trick of carpentry, no trap-door?
4.5: None, sir. My lodgings are on the third floor of a boarding-house in Bloomsbury.
8.0: The door was locked, the window shut, and yet the instrument, an upright pianoforte of German make, ceased to exist before my eyes.
5.7: My dear Holmes, surely this is a delusion. Our visitor was overwrought, fatigued perhaps from labour at his art.
4.2: I myself, in medical practice, have known patients who...
3.8: Hush, Watson. Let us never mistake the improbable for the impossible.
5.0: Our client's senses may have deceived him, but we must not permit our reason to do the same.
0.3: Ah!
4.2: Pay continue, Mr. Penfield. Did you at once search the chamber?
4.9: Indeed I did, sir. I examined every corner, opened the wardrobe, even peered beneath the bed,
2.6: as if a pianoforte might conceal itself there.
2.3: Neighbours heard my outcry and came running.
1.1: They too saw the room,
2.8: bare save for the stool and the folio upon it.
1.2: My landlady insists.
1.1: I have gone mad.
1.0: But I swear to you, mister.
0.3: Mister!
3.5: Holmes, the piano was there one instant and gone the next.
2.5: And the sheet music you carry,
3.3: this was composed upon that same vanished instrument.
0.7: Yes, sir.
2.2: Every note of it, without the instrument,
3.0: I cannot refine the piece, nor can I rehearse.
3.5: My reputation and my livelihood both depend upon the concert.
3.1: Unless I recover the Piano Forte, or at the very least,
2.9: solve the riddle of its disappearance, I am undone.
4.6: Holmes rose and paced the room, his long strides carrying him from heart to window and back again.
3.2: He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then turned to me with a glint in his eye.
3.9: Watson, you recall my remark, not ten minutes past,
2.7: that Baker Street would not remain quiet tonight?
2.4: The game, it seems, has begun.
1.5: A vanishing piano, Watson.
2.0: Have you ever heard of such a marvel?
0.8: Never, Holmes.
3.3: And I confess, I still struggle to believe it possible.
5.0: That is because you rely upon probability rather than possibility.
3.5: The improbable, my dear friend, happens daily.
5.0: It is only the impossible that remains forever barred.
4.0: Let us then ascertain whether Mr. Sin, whether Mr.
4.0: Penfield's pianoforte is improbable or impossible.
4.3: Mr. Penfield, you must take us to your lodgings at once.
4.3: With all my heart, sir, I have prayed for nothing, so much as your assistance.
2.3: But I warn you, the landlady is hostile.
3.2: She believes me deranged and would prefer the matter hushed up.
9.7: So much the better. Opposition sharpens the wits. Watson, your hat and coat. We go to Bloomsbury.
4.0: Penfield clutched his photo upon his lap as though it were life itself.
5.0: I, for my part, could not dispel the image of a piano vanishing before the eyes of its player.
4.0: The city seemed to close in around us, whispering of secrets hidden in shadow,
4.0: as we drove towards the first act of a most singular mystery.
5.0: The descent into the lower rooms of Mrs. Gaskill's boarding house was accomplished
4.0: with much creaking of timbers and muttered protests from the landlady,
3.0: who had reappeared upon hearing our footsteps.
4.0: The candlelight trembled against wallpaper, already blistered with damp,
3.2: and the air drew close with the odor of boiled cabbage and cold smoke.
1.2: Hmm, Mr. Hmm.
4.2: Hemphine followed like a man condemned, clutching his folio tightly against his dress,
2.6: while Holmes moved ahead with swift, noiseless tread,
2.8: pausing at every landing to examine the walls, the banisters,
2.3: the very nails that held the carpet runner in place.
2.9: Watson, observe the spacing of these boards.
3.1: They are old oak, but recently disturbed.
3.0: Note the faint discolouration along the edges.
4.3: Something has been lifted here and replaced within the last month.
2.2: Yes, Holmes, I see the difference in you,
2.1: though I should have walked past without remarking it.
0.6: Precisely.
3.1: The criminal counts upon the public's blindness to detail.
3.1: To the trained eye, however, each grain of wood is a witness.
2.8: Now let us inquire of Mrs. Gaskell.
2.2: If you're meaning the floor, sir,
1.9: it was repaired a fortnight ago.
3.5: My second-floor lodger complained of drafts.
3.0: A carpenter from Holborn came to lay new planks.
1.4: Hey, just so.
2.4: And what was the name of this carpenter?
1.0: I couldn't tell you.
1.9: Some tall fellow with a red beard.
3.0: I paid him in coin and thought no more about it.
0.5: A pity.
3.7: Yet red beards like pianos cannot vanish without trace.
2.1: Watson, make a note of it
5.1: Now, let us see what lies immediately beneath Mr. Penfew's chamber
3.8: We entered the second floor room, which was at present unoccupied
3.8: Its bed stripped bare, its furniture cloaked in dust sheets
3.1: Holmes paced to the centre of the floor and tapped with his cane
3.7: producing a hollow resonance unlike the solid tone one would expect
2.4: He dropped to one knee, pressed his ear against the boards
2.0: and then smiled in quiet satisfaction
3.0: There, Watson, do you not hear it?
6.1: A cavity beneath, large enough, I dare say, to swallow more than draughts, large enough,
2.3: perhaps, for an entire piano forte.
3.7: A hidden chamber, then the piano may not have left the house at all.
0.6: Exactly.
6.7: Now, the question remains, by what mechanism was it lowered from above without Mr. Penfield
1.4: perceiving the transition?
0.9: Lowered, sir?
1.1: You astonish me.
2.0: Surely I would have fez the descent beneath me.
1.3: Would you?
4.7: Consider, the player is absorbed in his art,
4.4: his mind fixed upon the score, his hands occupied upon the keys.
3.9: If the entire floor beneath the instrument descended slowly,
3.3: by counterweight, perhaps, or hydraulic piston,
2.4: you might experience only a curious vibration,
3.2: such as you described, a hum beneath the floorboards.
0.8: Oh!
1.3: Thumbs' words struck me
1.4: with the force of revelation.
2.7: The notion of an entire piano
2.1: being swallowed by the earth seemed wild
2.2: and yet the hollow echo of the boards
1.0: lent it credence.
1.6: My friend's eyes shone with excitement
1.9: like a scientist on the brink of discovery.
2.6: Watson, fetch that poker from the fireplace.
2.1: We shall test these boards for weakness.
1.2: I complied
2.4: and together we prized up a length of flooring.
0.8: Beneath lay darkness
4.8: But as Holmes lowered the candle into the aperture, the flickering light revealed an astonishing sight.
4.6: A shaft descending into the depths of the house, lined with wooden beams and fitted with ropes and pulleys.
6.3: At the bottom, far below, we glimpsed the curved outline of what could only be a piano, resting silently in the gloom.
2.3: Good heavens, there it is, the instrument itself.
2.0: Merciful Providence, my piano.
2.5: So much for vanishing into thin air.
7.0: The trick, Watson, is as old as a stage, a trap door, ingeniously concealed,
3.2: through which the entire pianoforte has been lowered.
1.3: The hum.
2.6: Penfield heard was the sound of machinery.
1.9: The question is, why?
3.2: With Holmes's guidance, we descended to the ground floor,
2.9: where a locked door barred our way to the cellars.
5.1: Mrs. Gaskell, though reluctant, produced a key muttering of nonsense and foolishness.
3.7: Within, we found a cavernous space, its walls lined with coal and firewood,
3.9: but in the centre stood a wooden platform connected to ropes, wheels and counterweights.
6.2: On that platform, like some sacrificial idol, rested the pianoforte, unscathed but eerily silent.
1.6: There you have it, Watson.
5.9: a perfectly contrived stage elevator concealed within a humble boarding house.
5.5: Such craftsmanship bespeaks not a common carpenter, but a mechanic of considerable skill.
3.5: See the polish of the wheels, the precision of the grooves.
2.5: This is the work of a master.
4.0: But to what end? Why lower a piano into the cellars beneath its owner's nose?
2.9: That, my dear fellow, is the heart of the mystery.
2.6: Peft is the obvious explanation
3.0: Yet the instrument remains here untouched
1.5: Sabotage?
0.7: Perhaps
2.6: Or perhaps something more elaborate
2.9: Something that concerns not the piano itself
1.9: But the music it bears
2.0: You bewilder me, sir
2.1: Who would wish to sabotage my work?
2.5: I am no celebrity, only a struggling composer
5.1: And yet, Mr. Penfield
5.4: Even a struggling composer may stumble upon a melody others desire to suppress.
3.7: Tell me, your composition, does it borrow from any source,
3.3: any folk song, any secret theme entrusted to you?
3.1: None, sir. The music is wholly my own, though.
2.1: Hmm. Though what? Hmm.
3.3: There is one peculiarity. The central motif came to me in a dream.
2.0: I awoke with it ringing in my ears,
3.3: as though some unseen musician had played it to me in the night.
4.1: I wrote it down at once, and it has since become the very soul of my concerto.
2.7: Holmes's brows knitted, and he muttered half to himself,
4.2: A melody in a dream, a piano swallowed by machinery,
2.7: a brass fragment that does not belong.
3.6: Watson, we are upon the edge of something curious indeed.
3.8: Mark me, this affair reaches deeper than Bloomsbury.
4.5: I must know who built this contrivance and for whose hand.
1.4: Then you suspect a conspiracy?
5.6: I suspect only that human ingenuity rarely expends itself without motive.
4.8: Somewhere in London is a man with a red beard and a talent for hidden machinery.
2.9: Find him, Watson, and we find our truth.
5.7: Meanwhile, Mr. Penfield, I urge you to guard your score most carefully.
6.5: For if your enemies cannot steal your piano, they may attempt to steal the song itself.
5.5: At that moment, a distant bell tolled the hour, its mournfully clang echoing through the cellar like a warning.
2.8: Holmes extinguished the candle and straightened to his full height.
3.3: His face was grave, yet his eyes glittered with anticipation.
2.9: Come, gentlemen, we have seen enough for tonight.
3.0: Tomorrow we hunt the man with the red beard.
4.4: Thus ended the first stage of our adventure.
2.2: A piano found, yet the riddle deepened,
2.4: a mystery solved, yet a greater enigma born.
2.8: I could not then imagine how perilous our quest would become,
2.8: nor how the song itself would draw us into a web of intrigue
2.1: that reached far beyond the walls of Bloomsbury.
2.3: When morning broke over Baker Street the following day,
3.0: the fog had lifted, and Mazel, the air still hung heavy
2.3: with the acrid smoke of a thousand chimneys.
2.4: Holmes had risen before me, as was often his custom,
4.4: and when I emerged from my room, I found him already at the table with maps, directories
3.2: and his chemical apparatus scattered around him in chaotic order.
2.3: He had exchanged his dressing gown for a tweed suit
4.7: and the energy in his movements told me that his mind had raced far into the mystery during the night.
3.3: Holmes, you look as though you have already solved the case before breakfast.
1.4: Not solved, Watson.
2.7: Merely sharpened the tools with which to cut.
2.9: We are in pursuit of a red-bearded mechanic,
7.2: a craftsman of no mean ability, who installed a trap capable of lowering an entire pianoforte
7.5: into the bowels of a Broomsbury boarding-house. Such a man cannot be common. London swarms with
5.6: tinkers and carpenters, but few who could accomplish such engineering in secrecy.
5.4: Therefore he must be known in certain circles. And how do you propose to find him?
4.7: By the oldest method of all, my dear fellow, inquiry,
5.1: I have already dispatched young Wiggins and his Baker Street irregulars
3.4: to gorm the workshops of Holborn and Clerkenwell.
2.2: A red-beard Watson is a beacon.
2.2: With luck, by noon we shall have a name.
2.5: As if on cue, there came a tapping at the door,
2.5: and in shuffle Wiggins, the street urchin,
3.7: whose quick eyes and nimble feet had served us in many an adventure,
3.0: He removed his cap and spoke with his usual bluntness.
1.3: Beg pardon, Mr. Holmes.
0.6: We found dine.
3.3: Name, oh Ezekiel Trenchard, keeps a whisk shop off Leather Lane.
2.6: Folks call him Red Zeke on account of the whiskers.
1.2: Bids are contraptions.
3.3: Stage rigs, hidden doors, trap mechanisms for them, theaters.
2.9: Got a reputation for being clever, but not over-scrupulous.
0.9: Excellent, Wiggins.
3.2: You and your lads have earned your shillings handsomely.
4.3: Here, take this coin and keep watch upon Mr. Trenchard's premises.
2.0: Report to me, any visitor of note.
3.2: Listen, we go at once to Leather Lane.
2.9: Soon we were rattling through the crowded streets in a cab,
1.2: home silent and intent.
1.9: I armed with my revolver by long habit,
1.8: though half convinced it would not be needed.
2.1: Leather Lane proved a narrow thoroughfare
2.7: cluttered with coast among us guards and shouting hawkers.
1.7: At its far end we found the place,
2.6: a grimy workshop with windows thick with soot,
4.1: and above the door, a fading sign, E. Plenchard, Engineer of Mechanisms.
5.8: Observe, Watson, the iron filings upon the sill, the heavy crates by the entrance.
4.2: Business here is active, though the sign suggests disuse.
2.7: Consumment in plain sight, as ever.
2.8: We entered and were met with a curious sight.
2.1: The interior resembled a magician's storeroom.
3.8: Wheels, pulleys, counterweights, and elaborate frames crowded every surface.
6.0: At the far bench, bending over a set of blueprints, stood a broad-shouldered man with a mane of flaming beard.
2.3: He straightened, eyes narrowing at our intrusion.
3.9: Who are ye and what's your business in Ezekiel Trenchard's shop?
4.8: Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and this is my colleague, Dr. Watson.
8.1: We come regarding a certain Ganoforte, lowered into a cellar by means of a trap you constructed in a Bloomsbury house.
3.0: So, the trap worked, eh?
1.5: Ha! I told him it would.
2.0: Smooth as silk, down she goes.
1.9: But what business is that of yours?
2.4: The business of justice, Mr. Trenchard.
3.0: You were hired by someone to create this contrivance.
1.6: I must know who.
1.3: Now, why should I tell you?
1.9: My clients pay well for silence.
3.6: Because your client intends more than theatrics.
7.0: and you may find yourself accessory to a crime far darker than mere carpentry.
1.8: Consider carefully, Mr. Trenchard.
4.6: The law makes no distinction between the man who builds the pistol
2.7: and the man who pulls the trigger.
4.8: The mechanic's ruddy face paled somewhat, though his eyes still glittered with defiance.
4.4: I was paid in sovereigns to build a stage lift, not to ask questions.
1.8: But, well, I'll tell you this much.
2.2: The man who hired me called himself Mr. Green.
3.2: Thin fellow. Foreign accent. Eyes sharp as knives.
2.5: He brought sketches. Knew what he wanted.
2.5: Paid half in advance, half on completion.
0.9: That's all I know.
1.7: A foreign accent, you say?
2.1: Could you identify his nationality?
1.9: German, maybe. Or Austrian.
1.9: Something from the continent, that's sure.
2.2: Indeed. And this Mr. Green?
3.0: did he mention why he required the piano to vanish?
1.2: Not in so many words.
1.5: Only said the music was dangerous,
2.3: that it must be silenced before it was heard.
2.5: I thought him cracked, but his money was sound.
1.0: Dangerous music.
1.8: Holmes exchanged a glance with me,
1.7: his brows lifting in silent emphasis.
1.1: Dangerous music!
2.2: The phrase struck a chord of unease within me.
3.5: Holmes, surely he does not mean that Mr. Penfield's composition holds some secret?
11.9: It seems increasingly probable, Watson. Music may convey more than melody. Codes, signals, even mathematical formulae can be embedded within notes.
3.0: Mr. Trenchard! Did Mr. Trenchard!
3.5: Green, give any instruction beyond the trap's construction?
7.6: Only this, that once the piano was lowered, it must remain below until he returned with men to fetch it away.
3.3: I asked when that might be, but he only laughed and said,
1.6: when the last note is played.
1.4: A curious phrase indeed.
1.7: Very well, Mr. Gaines.
4.4: Trenchard, you have been frank, and I shall not press you further.
1.0: But take warning.
3.9: If harm comes of this scheme, your name will not be spared.
0.6: Good day.
3.0: With that, Owens turned upon his heel and strode into the street,
2.0: leaving the mechanic to mutter among his gears.
1.9: I hurried after him, bewildered.
4.8: Holmes, what can it mean? Dangerous musics? Surely a tune is but a tune.
2.8: Do not underestimate the subtle arts, Watson.
5.7: Consider the ancients who believed music could stir armies or calm tempests.
4.0: Consider the mathematician who may encode a cipher within notes.
4.5: Suppose, mister, Penfield's melody, born in a dream, he says,
3.1: contains a secret intended never to be revealed.
4.7: But revealed by whom?
3.4: That, my dear fellow, is what we must discover.
2.3: Come, we return to Bigger Street.
2.0: There is research to be done.
3.7: Back at our lodgings, Holmes immersed himself in his volumes of arcane knowledge.
3.5: He rifled through treatises on cryptography, histories of secret societies,
2.5: and even monographs upon the psychology of music.
2.7: All afternoon he pored over staves and scales,
3.7: humming fragments of Penfield's score that the composer had left with us.
3.1: At last, as twilight fell, he sprang up with a cry of triumph.
2.8: Watson, it is as I suspected.
1.8: The motif concedes a code.
0.4: Look here.
1.8: Take the first note of each bar.
2.7: Convert its pitch to a letter by simple substitution.
1.1: And what do you read?
4.2: I bent over the paper, and slowly the letters resolved themselves into words.
1.0: My heart gave a leap.
1.3: Oh, the key lies in Vienna.
2.0: Good heavens, Holmes, it is a message.
4.0: Precisely. And not merely a message, but a directive.
4.6: Someone has planted within Penfield's dream a melody
4.6: which conceals the command to seek a key in Vienna.
2.2: The question is, who and why?
2.0: At that instant, a knock rattled the door.
1.8: Mrs. Hudson entered, pale and trembling.
3.1: Mr. Holmes, there's a gentleman below asking for you.
5.8: says his name is Green. Will you see him? Holmes's eyes flashed. He reached for his violin,
4.0: set it upon the table as though it were a weapon and whispered to me in urgent tones.
4.6: The game quickens, Watson. Mr. Green has come to us of his own accord.
5.1: Ready yourself. We may at last confront the mind behind the vanishing piano.
5.2: The fire burned low in our Baker Street sitting room, casting long flickering shadows against
6.4: the bookshelves and the framed Persian slipper on the mantle. Mrs. Hudson had scarcely finished
4.3: announcing the visitor when the man himself entered, and I confess my blood chilled at the
5.7: sight. He was tall, gaunt, with the pallor of one who lived more in lamplight than under the sun.
4.1: He was trim-close, his hair slick-bat with continental precision, but it was his eyes
6.1: that arrested me, icy-gray, piercing, restless, darting from Holmes to myself and back again
1.7: with the vigilance of a predator.
2.5: Herr Holmes, said he in a voice soft yet cutting,
1.4: and Dr. Watson, ja?
3.0: So the hounds have scented me sooner than I expected.
2.8: Mr. Green, or should I say Herr Grun,
1.8: Austrian, perhaps Prussian,
1.4: certainly of the German tongue,
3.8: you honour us by stepping into our den voluntarily.
1.5: May I offer you a chair?
1.7: Your courtesy is wasted, sir.
1.1: I came not for tea,
4.8: but to reclaim what is mine, the piano, and the melody that resided in it.
2.0: You have interfered sufficiently.
2.2: Yours? The piano belongs to Mr. Mr.
4.0: Dild, Enfield, a humble composer who never sought entanglement with espionage.
1.7: Tote dows it to being biny, this.
2.8: Ah, poor Penfield, a vessel only, not the source.
3.3: He dreamed the melody because it was planted in him.
1.2: A modic suggestion, gentlemen.
4.2: We of the continent have studied such arts deeply.
4.5: In a moment between waking and sleep, we gave him the theme, never knowing if it would blossom.
2.5: It did, and it contained more than music.
4.5: A cipher encoding the phrase, the key lies in Vienna.
2.4: We have already deciphered it, Herr Grun.
2.8: But tell me, what key and why Vienna?
1.7: You are clever, Holmes, but not omniscient.
5.5: omniscient. The melody concealed the location of a document, an agreement signed secretly between
5.4: two empires that could plunge Europe into chaos if revealed. The piano was to vanish until we
6.6: might transport it safely abroad. But you, you have meddled. His voice rose and for a moment
4.7: the mask of control slipped, revealing the fanatic beneath. Holmes, however, remained
4.2: unruffled, tapping his long fingers together as though playing an invisible clavier.
3.4: Your plan was ingenious, I grant you
2.8: To hide a cipher within a tune
2.8: Entrusted to a dreamer who believed it
2.6: His own composition, admirable
2.9: But you erred in one respect
2.2: And that is?
2.2: In thinking that London
3.6: The city with eyes and ears in every alley
4.6: Would allow a foreign agent to burrow unseen
4.9: Your red-bearded accomplice betrayed you by his very uniqueness
3.6: and your arrogance brought you to my doorstep.
1.8: Groom's hand twitched toward his coat pocket,
3.7: but quicker than thought Holmes had drawn the revolver he seldom carried,
1.3: save at direst need.
2.0: How do not, Herr Groom?
2.3: My friend Watson also carries an arm,
5.9: and unlike myself he has spent service years firing it in earnest.
4.4: Track and indeed sir, I said firmly, though my heart pounded.
0.7: Smiling thinly.
2.4: So, you have me tracked, but what will you do, Holmes?
0.9: Turn me to Skarnanyard?
2.7: They will not grasp the significance of what I bear.
1.8: The melody is still in my mind.
4.4: The key remains hidden in Vienna, awaiting only the one who can read the notes.
5.2: Your mind perhaps, but music may be copied, analysed, destroyed.
7.0: The tomb lies also with me now, and I have no intention of allowing it into careless hands.
8.0: As for you, Lestrade shall know what to do with an agent of espionage who traffics in stolen secrets.
7.0: At that moment, heavy boots slattered upon the stairs, and Inspector Lestrade himself burst into the room, breathless but resolute.
3.0: Horns, it seemed, had sent a telegram earlier in the day.
5.3: Holmes, Watson, I came as quick as I could, and this, I take it, is our quarry.
7.5: Indeed, Lestrade. Herr Grün, alias Mr. Green, foreign agent, mastermind of the vanishing piano.
2.7: Hmm, he is yours. Hmm.
4.1: Bitterly, so the curtain falls. But mark me, Holmes, the play is not ended.
3.1: Vienna will yet sing, and when she does, Europe shall tremble.
5.2: With iron restraint, Lestrade's men clapped irons upon the spy and bore him,
0.9: struggling down the stairs.
4.2: The echoes of his threats lingered in the room long after his footsteps had faded.
2.2: The days that followed were filled with inquiry.
4.3: The Foreign Office, apprised of the matter, hushed the affair with typical discretion,
3.8: whispering only of continental intrigues and tanking Holmes in guarded phrases.
3.9: Mr. Herm, Penfield the composer, was released from suspicion,
4.9: though he vowed never again to trust a melody that arrived unbidden in his dreams.
3.1: Horns, I said one evening, as we sat once more by our fire.
2.5: I cannot shake the unease that blings to this case.
2.5: A melody planted like a parasite in the mind,
1.5: a piano swallowed by the earth,
3.1: and a spy who claims that the fate of Europe rests upon a tune.
1.5: It all seems scarcely credible.
1.8: Yet credible it is, Watson.
3.0: Men will go to astounding lengths for power.
2.6: Today it is ink upon a treaty.
3.2: Tomorrow, it may be a code hidden in music.
2.4: The human mind is both lock and key,
3.1: and there will always be those who seek to master it.
0.8: But what of the message?
1.1: The key lies in Vienna.
2.7: Have we truly forestalled danger or only delayed it?
2.7: We have struck a blow, not finished the war.
2.6: Another agent may pursue the secret in Vienna,
3.4: but Herr Grün's immediate scheme is ended.
4.2: Our duty lies not in reshaping empires,
4.2: but in defending the innocent who stumble, like Penfield,
2.1: into the path of darker designs.
1.8: I could not argue with this philosophy,
1.6: though it left me with a gnawing sense
3.1: that larger forces moved beyond the grasp of any detective.
2.3: However brilliant, Holmes leaned back,
2.5: his keen profile illuminated by the lamplight,
1.6: and drew his violin from its case.
6.4: Listen, Watson, here is the theme as Penfield dreamed it.
3.5: He played the haunting string, notes rising like ghosts in the air.
5.3: To my ears it was both beautiful and sorrowful, a whisper from some realm beyond reason.
3.6: Yet as Holmes played, I fancied I heard beneath the melody another voice,
2.5: the echo of groom's warning that Vienna would yet sing.
2.4: When the final note faded, Holmes lowered the bow,
3.4: though his eyes, half-closed, betrayed a fatigue deeper than physical.
11.5: it is finished watson for now remember always every tune has its last note the trick is to know when it has truly ended
3.3: And so, continued the affair of the song of the vanishing piano.
4.9: A case unlike any other, where espionage, music and human imagination intertwined.
3.7: To this day, whenever I hear the lonely strains of a violin in the night,
2.9: I recall the vision of that piano sinking into the earth.
3.5: The cry of a spy undone and the figure of Sherlock Holmes declaring,
3.4: with his customary calm, that for him, everything was elementary.
