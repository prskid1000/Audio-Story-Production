5.760: It was in the late autumn of 1888 that one of the most singular cases in the long annals of my ASOC,
2.520: Ayeshan with Sherlock Holmes, first presented itself.
4.380: The days had grown short, and the fog of London lay upon the city like a barrier shroud.
3.620: Chasom at the ward, I recall clearly the dim yellow of the gas lamps,
1.680: struggling feebly through the haze,
3.420: the constant clatter of handsome gabs upon wet cobblestones,
3.160: and the peculiar air of dread which hung upon us all,
1.740: though none could say precisely why.
3.040: At Baker Street, however, the mood was different.
2.400: Our sitting room was warmed by a bright coal fire,
2.300: the familiar scent of pipe smoke thick in the air,
2.000: and my companion lay sprawled upon the settee,
1.700: his long thin frame stretched at ease,
2.220: while his keen grey eyes remained anything but idle.
2.580: He was studying a slip of paper with such intensity
2.880: that I wondered if it might combust beneath his gaze.
3.140: You have been upon that same strap for nearly an hour, Holmes.
3.280: Ope! What intelligence does it contain that should so rivet you?
4.140: merely a request for aid, my dear Watson,
2.480: a request clothed in vagueness,
2.420: which makes it all the more interesting.
2.260: The letter purports to come from a certain
1.980: Colonel Sir Reginald Stanhope,
2.880: recently returned from colonial service in India.
2.600: He writes of a family seat in Devonshire
2.940: and of a curse said to dwell upon the waterfall
1.300: near his estate.
0.760: A curse, Holmes?
2.600: Surely you cannot lend credence to such superstition.
5.900: Superstition is but the refuge of those who have not yet perceived the chain of cause and effect.
3.900: I do not for an instant accept the existence of curses.
4.720: Yet I observe with interest the effect of such beliefs upon the human mind
3.140: and the human conduct that springs therefrom.
3.080: Remember, Watson, it is not the legend that kills.
4.260: It is the man who acts under the influence of the legend.
5.940: danger aplenty. And what action do you propose we take? Why, we go to Devonshire, of course.
6.940: The Colonel requests our presence with urgency. His letter bears signs of haste. The ink blot here,
6.840: the irregular strokes there. He is a man of disciplined habits, no doubt. Yet this letter
5.700: reveals agitation. Something has already occurred, which has shaken him from composure.
3.000: You read all that from a blot of ink?
2.960: From the blot, and from the tremor in the line,
2.720: and from the very choice of words, my dear fellow.
1.640: It is all elementary.
1.460: Warning, thus it was settled.
1.880: By the following morning we had packed our cases,
2.680: and with little delay were on the train bound for the west.
1.780: The journey was long and dreary,
1.940: the rain streaking upon the carriage windows,
2.400: while I occupied myself with my medical notes
1.880: and Holmes with his pipe and silence.
4.620: Yet I could not shake from my mind the phrase which he had read aloud from the colonel's letter.
2.000: The curse of the waterfall has claimed another.
2.560: At Exeter Station we were met by the colonel himself,
5.580: a tall, spare man of military bearing, with silvered hair and a face deeply aligned by both sun and worry.
5.480: His handshake was firm, yet his eyes betrayed an unrest that no discipline could entirely conceal.
5.140: Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to see you.
2.620: You come at a most desperate hour.
1.320: We lose no time, Colonel.
3.920: Tell us, has another death indeed occurred, as your letter implied?
2.420: Aye, my own steward, Samuel Price.
0.820: Samuel Price.
5.780: Two nights ago, he was found lifeless at the foot of the great waterfall that lies within our estate.
7.260: And what chins my blood, sir, is that he is the third three men in as many months, each claimed in the self-same fashion.
2.040: You suggest they fell?
1.700: Some say fell, some say jumped
2.540: And the villagers whisper that they were drawn
2.060: Dread by a force unseen
2.720: They call it the curse of the Stanhope waterfall
1.960: I cannot abide such talk
2.040: But I cannot deny the deaths either
5.060: You are wise to reject superstition, Colonel
3.860: Yet you are also wise to summon me
2.660: We shall look upon this waterfall
2.460: and upon the bodies if possible,
2.580: for the dead, no less than the living,
3.220: may yield up their secrets to an inquiring eye.
1.800: The colonel nodded gravely,
1.700: and soon we were seated within his carriage,
2.460: the horses drawing us through the winding Devonshire lanes.
2.240: The landscape grew wilder as we advanced,
2.660: great tors of granite rising against the darkening sky
3.640: and a moor that stretched desolate and silent save for the wind.
1.980: At last we came in sight of Stanhope Hall,
3.720: a vast grey edifice standing grim against the encroaching night,
3.840: and beyond it, through the mist, I glimpsed the white roar of tumbling water.
3.160: That night, after a hurried supper in the echoing dining hall,
1.420: we were conducted to our chambers.
3.700: I confess that fatigue weighed heavily upon me, but not so upon Holmes.
3.680: Long after the household had retired, I found him at the window of our shared room,
3.480: his silhouette stark against the moonlight, gazing out toward the waterfall.
2.700: Holmes, where you never sleep, the hour grows late.
6.000: Sleep, Watson, is for those who have not a mystery roaring in their ears.
3.600: Do you not hear it, the voice of that waterfall,
2.880: nature herself thundering like an orator,
4.580: proclaiming some dreadful truth which man has not yet deciphered?
1.940: To me it is but water tumbling over rocks.
3.380: And therein lies the difference between us, my dear fellow.
3.420: To you the sound is but sound.
3.300: To me, it is the overture to a drama.
4.500: Come the morrow, we shall attend the stage and watch the play unfold.
4.040: With that, he turned from the window, his keen eyes alight with anticipation,
2.560: and I knew that whatever dark force haunted this place,
2.600: Sherlock Holmes had already cast his lot against it.
2.460: The following day, dawned with a sky of iron,
3.440: Colonel Stanhope led us to the falls, a mile's walk across sodden fields,
3.940: and into a narrow gorge where the land seemed to close about us like a pair of jaws.
15.240: there through the mist and spray the waterfall revealed itself in its awful grandeur thundering down from a height of sixty feet into a cauldron of foam below the very ground trembled with its power by heavens holmes to stumble upon these rocks would be certain death
12.140: just so watson and yet note the path though perilous it is still a path one does not tumble here by chance but rather by design or compulsion
12.160: horns crouched upon the whetstones his gaze flitting from mark to mark with an intensity that left me bewildered he plucked up a broken branch sniffed it cast it aside then examined a scuff upon the rock face with his lens
17.500: observe watson the print of a boot the heel is square the tread heavy a labourer's boot consistent with that of a steward yet see here another mark overlaying it a finer sole narrow likely that of a lady
4.340: And here, the drag of a cane or walking stick.
1.700: Curious, most curious.
1.480: You astonish me, Holmes.
1.820: Are you suggesting that another was with him?
1.120: I suggest nothing.
1.140: I merely observe.
3.160: But the conclusion, when it comes, will brook no doubt.
2.800: At that instant, a sharp cry rang out from behind us.
2.260: A return to behold a young woman, pale and trembling,
1.180: who had approached unobserved.
2.820: She was clad in a simple gown, her hair disordered,
1.560: her eyes wide with fear.
1.660: You must not go nearer.
0.900: The falls are cursed.
2.260: Do not tempt fate as the others did.
1.700: Mary, what are you doing here?
1.220: Return to the hall at once.
1.420: I cannot, father.
2.480: I cannot rest while the curse remains.
1.340: Each night I dream of it
1.940: and each day I feel its pull.
1.700: Mr. Holmes, you must save us.
0.640: You must.
1.840: Holmes bowed with grave courtesy,
2.840: yet his eyes shone with that peculiar game I had come to recognize,
2.680: the game of discovery hovering just beyond his reach.
4.420: Miss Stanhope, I assure you I shall leave no stone unturned.
2.740: But I must beg you to tell me all you know.
2.740: The safety of others may depend upon it.
3.260: And so, by the thundering roar of the cursed waterfall,
1.220: the tale began to unravel.
2.440: The strange apparition of young Miss Mary Stanhope,
4.700: trembling by the torrent, haunted my thoughts throughout that day. We returned with her and
4.320: the Colonel to the hall, the mist closing behind us like the curtain of some grim theatre. Holmes,
5.140: however, appeared invigorated rather than troubled. I recognised that eager light in his eye,
4.660: which always betokened that he scented a pew. Holmes, what do you make of the girl's terror?
3.940: Is she merely afflicted with the common superstition of these parts, or do you suspect
5.700: she knows more than she dares reveal? A very pertinent question, Watson. Observe her manner.
5.180: agitation genuine, yet her words chosen with curious restraint.
4.720: She fears the waterfall, but also fears something more immediate.
5.060: Did you note how her glance shifted toward her father before she spoke?
3.540: Indeed I did, yet surely you would not suggest that the Colonel himself?
5.100: I suggest nothing as yet, but I record every gesture, every hesitation.
4.380: one never knows which trifle may illuminate the whole.
3.440: That evening, after supper, Holmes and I took a stroll through the village
1.740: which lay a short distance from the hall.
2.020: The air was heavy with smoke from peat fires
3.000: and the narrow lanes echoed with the gossip of rustic folk
2.580: who regarded us with a mixture of suspicion and hope.
3.080: The tale of the waterfall had evidently cast a pall over the community.
3.220: The people stared at us as though we carried the cure to their plague.
7.200: So we may, in a sense. Fear spreads like contagion, and nothing will allay it but reason.
6.220: Come, let us enter this inn. I perceive from the sign that it is the king's arms,
3.520: and such a place is the crucible of village rumour.
5.140: Within, we found a low ceiling chamber, warm with firelight and loud with the murmur of voices.
5.500: The landlord, a stout man with ruddy cheeks, eyed us with curiosity as we ordered ale and
4.460: seated ourselves at a corner table. It was not long before a knot of villagers approached,
3.540: emboldened perhaps by the drink or by our London attire.
3.140: Beg pardon, sirs, but you're from the hall, ain't you? Strangers come for the curse, we reckoned.
5.720: We come at the invitation of Colonel Stanhope to inquire into the deaths at the waterfall.
3.280: You call it a curse. Pray, tell me why.
3.940: Could have been that way since old Sir William's days, sir. Long ago, before the Colonel's time,
3.980: Sir William wronged a gypsy woman, drove her from the land with cruel words.
3.780: She set her spell upon the fall, swore that any man who drew water there would find death.
3.520: First it was cattle, then shepherds, and now, God help us, it's back again.
2.100: Surely you cannot credit such a tale in this century?
4.280: Begging your pardon, doctor, but we've seen too many bodies fetched from the pool below.
3.740: My own brother swore he heard voices in the spray calling him by name.
2.260: He scarce slept after, till he was found gone.
8.700: Voices, you say? Most interesting. And tell me, have these deaths occurred at any particular hour?
5.020: Always at night, sir. Darker the moon, mostly. Folks say the falls glow then like silver fire.
3.240: Holmes's eyes glittered, though he masked it quickly by sipping his ale.
9.460: Gentlemen, madam, I thank you for your candour. Rest assured, I mean to examine every feature of this so-called curse.
7.420: And I give you my solemn word. If it is the work of mortal hands, those hands shall be uncovered.
3.720: A murmur of approval and relief ran through the company, though some crossed themselves
5.860: fortively, as though to ward against, meddling with forces unseen. Holmes, however, rose abruptly
4.940: and beckoned me to follow. Big gut, you depart so soon? We might have learned more,
7.180: tasis te hern. We have learned precisely enough. The legend of the gypsy, the voices in the spray,
6.520: the glow of the water, all fragments of a mosaic which begins to take form. Come, Watson,
5.500: the night is fine for observation. We quitted the inn and made our way back along the dark
5.000: lanes to the gorge. The roar of the waterfall greeted us like the growl of some monstrous beast.
5.140: The moon had risen, casting a pale glow upon the spray, which indeed shimmered with a spectral
5.980: light. By Jove, Holmes, it does glow see how the mist catches the moonlight, as though it were
6.580: silver flames. A beautiful optical effect, no doubt aided by certain minerals in the rock.
6.880: Yet beauty often conceals danger. Look there, do you see, upon the far side, a faint glimmer,
5.140: as of a lantern quickly extinguished? I see nothing, wait, yes, a flicker only.
1.260: Someone lurks yonder.
2.600: Indeed, we are not the only night watchers here.
2.600: Remain silent, Watson, and crouch low.
3.220: We hid behind a boulder, scarcely daring to breathe.
3.600: Minutes passed, and then we perceived a figure moving upon the opposite bank.
2.520: It paused, lifted something that caught the moonlight,
2.000: a rod perhaps, or a length of metal,
2.160: and seemed to place it into the torrent itself.
3.440: Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure melted into the darkness.
1.200: What devilry is this?
1.140: Holmes, did you see?
2.580: I saw enough to confirm my suspicion.
4.100: Come, Watson, we must examine that spot at first light.
4.640: For now, it would be folly to attempt the crossing in darkness.
4.300: I hardly slept that night, my mind restless with images of spectral lights
2.160: and shadowy figures by the roaring falls.
3.980: But Holmes seemed content, stretched upon his bed with the faintest of smiles,
2.740: as though he had glimpsed already the outline of truth.
6.260: At dawn we returned to the gorge, and with the colonel's permission descended to the place where the mysterious figure had stood.
2.840: Their homes bent with his lens and gave a cry of satisfaction.
8.800: See here, Watson, home, the imprint of boots, not the rough soles of a peasant, but well-made leather, narrow at the toe.
6.420: Read, and here scraps of wire, recently cut. The fellow was at work, not in worship.
1.060: At work upon what?
15.000: That is the question. But note how these wires lead into the torrent itself. They vanish beneath the spray. Someone has contrived a mechanism in connection with the falls, Watson, and I mean to discover its purpose.
5.120: Even as he spoke, a voice hailed us from the ridge above. It was Miss Mary, paying with alarm.
5.480: Mr. Holmes, father begs your presence at once. There has been another, another death.
3.340: Another? Good heavens! Who now?
2.420: Mr. James Trevor, the curate's son.
3.580: He was found at dawn dashed upon the rocks, just as the others.
1.980: Holmes's jaw set like iron.
2.040: Watson, the pace quickens.
3.420: The hand behind these tragedies grows bolder.
4.080: We must move with equal speed, lest more lives be claimed.
5.960: And so, with the roar of the waterfall at our backs and the cries of the villagers rising in dread,
4.820: we hastened once more toward the hall, knowing that the heart of the mystery was at last within our grasp.
4.740: The news of young James Trevor's death spread through the village like fire through dry brush.
5.400: By the time Holmes and I reached the hall, a grim crowd had already gathered about the stables where the body had been laid.
6.800: Faces bale with horror, peered at us, and whispers followed in our wake, as though we bore the judgment of fate itself.
4.920: The poor lad, hardly twenty, to be cut down in such a fashion is monstrous.
4.880: Monstrous, yes, but not mysterious, at least not in the supernatural sense.
2.760: Come, Watson, let us view the body.
3.440: The dead, as I often remind you, are eloquent witnesses.
3.120: Within the stable, the curate himself stood bowed with grief,
3.980: his hands trembling over the form of his son, which lay upon a makeshift bierge.
3.120: Holmes removed his hat solemnly and bent over the body.
1.780: his keen eyes missing no detail.
1.220: The skull is fractured.
1.980: He must have strut the rocks below the falls.
0.360: Indeed.
0.760: But see here,
1.480: the bruising upon the wrists,
1.820: the abrasions along the arms.
2.140: These are not the injuries of a fall alone.
1.240: No, Watson.
2.600: This youth struggled against some restraint
1.440: before he met his end.
1.080: You mean he was forced?
0.680: Precisely.
0.900: He was seized,
0.980: bound perhaps,
1.900: and then hurled into the torrent.
4.440: This was no accident nor curse, but deliberate murder.
1.920: A murmur of horror rose among those present.
2.520: Colonel Stanhope's face darkened as though with storm.
1.700: Then the fiend walks among us still.
2.480: Tell me, Mr. Holmes, who is guilty of this outrage?
3.360: My household shall not rest until justice is done.
0.980: Patience, Colonel.
2.860: The truth hides, but it cannot hide long.
3.980: We must ask not only who had the strength to commit this act,
6.040: but who had cause, and who possessed knowledge of the waterfall's secret paths.
4.820: Holmes turned his gaze upon the assembled servants, footmen, maids, and grooms,
2.080: each shrinking back from his piercing eyes.
2.700: Then he addressed them in a voice as calm as it was commanding.
6.380: If any among you knows aught that may bear upon these debts, speak now.
4.720: Silence is complicity, and complicity may in the end prove fatal.
7.460: Station none spoke though. I detected unease in more than one countenance at last home straightened replaced his hat and motioned me away
2.080: You think one of them is complicit? I
6.860: Think fear seals many mouths Watson, but I also think that the heart of this riddle lies not in
2.000: whispered superstition but in
2.000: tangible contrivance
3.520: We must return to the Falls at once. Yes
12.180: Once more we braved the gorge, the spray drenching us like rain. Holmes descended with fearless agility, his eyes scanning every inch of the cliff. At a ledge near the water's edge, he gave a cry of triumph.
7.520: Watson, see here iron rods driven into the rock, concealed by moss and spray, and attached.
3.960: Look, fine wires trailing into the torrent.
5.860: This is no natural feature, but an apparatus contrived by human ingenuity.
4.520: But for what purpose? Surely no man could work machinery beneath such a torrent.
4.300: On the contrary, the water itself is the machinery.
7.940: Observe these rods when connected by wire might serve to channel electricity or to create a resonance.
5.640: The roar of the falls may be used to mask some artificial sound.
2.320: Recall the villagers' tales of voices.
2.540: You suggest those voices were produced, engineered?
5.540: Exactly. Imagine a horn or tube concealed in the rocks conducting sound from some hidden operator.
4.320: A clever trick to instill terror in simple minds.
4.000: And terror, my dear Watson, is a potent weapon.
2.040: I confess, I shuddered at the thought.
2.980: To turn the very power of nature into an instrument of deception
2.380: was a devilry worthy of the keenest malice.
2.200: But who would contrive such a scheme, and why?
2.380: That is the next link in the chain.
2.760: But mark my words, the motive is not phantoms,
6.380: phantoms, but property, power, or passion. Always the same. Three, Watson.
4.440: As we clambered back to the path, a figure emerged from the trees. It was Miss Mary once
6.900: more, her face pale, her hands clasped tightly together. Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I beg you,
6.400: cease your investigations. Already too many have died. If you persist, I fear you too shall be
7.000: taken. Miss Stanhope, your concern does you credit, yet your words betray knowledge beyond
8.860: mere fear. You know something. Confess it. No, I only that the falls bring doom. I cannot explain
7.320: more. Cannot or will not. Very well, I shall not press you now. But understand this, truth
6.720: concealed breeds only further tragedy. Consider carefully where your silence may lead."
4.640: She turned away, tears glimmering in her eyes, and hurried back toward the hall. Holmes watched
4.880: her with narrowed gaze. She knows more than she admits, Holmes. Holmes!
7.120: Undoubtedly, she is caught in a net of loyalty and fear. The question is, loyalty to whom?
1.680: To her father? To another?
4.260: That evening, Holmes requested permission of Colonel Stanhope to examine the family archives.
4.700: We were conducted to a goomy chamber lined with ancient ledgers, parchments and maps.
4.020: Holmes set to work with his customary vigor, turning page after page with feverish haste.
3.540: Ha ha, here Watson, an old survey of the estate.
7.320: Note this passage, subterranean channel connecting the upper stream to the grotto beneath the falls.
6.040: Do you see? There exists a cavern hidden within the cascade itself.
6.660: A cavern? Then a man might lurk there unseen and produce the very voices of which the villagers speak.
8.460: Precisely. And more, he might even contrive to drag his victims into the torrent unseen by those above.
2.400: The perfect lair for a phantom.
3.080: At that moment, a footstep echoed in the corridor beyond.
2.960: Holmes kills the ledger sharply and motioned me to silence.
3.860: We waited only to hear the soft retreat of someone who had paused at the door.
0.820: Someone was listening.
4.000: Yes, and that someone now knows we are upon descent.
1.900: The game quickens, Watson.
2.860: And quicken it did, for scarcely had we retired to our chamber
3.420: when a cry rang out from below, followed by the crash of breaking gas.
3.200: We rushed down to find the library in disarray, the window shattered,
2.760: and the ledgers we had been studying scattered upon the floor.
2.640: The lantern lay overturned, its flame narrowly extinguished
1.620: before it could ignite the papers.
1.340: An attempt to destroy the evidence.
2.580: More than that, it was meant as a warning.
2.260: The enemy grows desperate, Watson.
2.860: But he reveals himself by his very fear.
2.800: We spent the remainder of that night in uneasy vigil.
2.140: Holmes paced the floor like a caged panther,
1.260: his mind working furiously.
6.020: At last, toward dawn, he halted before me, his eyes alight with the fire of resolution.
3.440: Watson, the curtain rises upon the final act.
5.900: I must inspect the cavern beneath the falls, and I must do so this very night.
2.300: But it is perilous in the extreme.
3.460: I shall require your steady hand and your revolver.
1.960: You may rely upon both homes.
1.040: Where you go, I go.
15.920: I knew I might count upon you, my dear fellow. Then skew yourself, for tonight we enter the very jaws of the so-called curse, and let us see if man's deceit may withstand the gaze of reason.
5.860: Thus, with the roar of the waterfall echoing ever in our ears, we prepared ourselves for the descent into darkness.
4.160: That night, the storm broke over Devonshire with a violence seldom seen.
2.320: The wind ratted shutters and tore at the trees
3.060: while the thunder of the fall seemed doubled by the heavens themselves.
4.480: Yet it was on that wide night that Holmes chose to penetrate the cavern hidden beneath the torrent.
4.100: Armed with lanterns, ropes and my revolver, we set out at midnight from the hall.
1.620: Colonel Stanhope would have detained us,
4.580: but Holmes merely bowed and assured him that the honour of his house depended upon swift action.
3.120: Miss Mary wept silently at the stairhead as we departed,
3.880: and I confess her pale face haunted me as we strode across the fields.
3.320: Holmes, do you truly think it wise to attempt this descent in such weather?
2.100: Current will be swollen to madness.
2.420: Precisely why we must attempt it tonight, Watson.
4.280: Our adversary will assume no man dares such a venture in this storm.
1.620: Secrecy is our ally.
1.000: Courage, my friend.
3.040: The truth lies within that roar.
5.440: Reaching the gorge, we found the waterfall a white fury, its spray lashing us like whips.
4.680: Holmes tied a stout rope about his waist and secured it to a tree, then handed me the second length.
5.740: Follow close, Watson. Keep the lantern high, and whatever happens, do not lose your footing.
2.200: The path is narrow, but sound.
3.920: Inch by inch we crept along the slippery ledge, the abyss yawning below.
3.960: At length Holmes pointed to a dark cleft, half hidden by the falling water.
4.720: With a cry he plunged forward, drawing me after, and in an instant we were within a cavern,
3.160: the roar of the cascade forming a thunderous curtain at the entrance.
3.680: By heavens, Holmes, what a place! This drotto might house an army unseen.
5.940: And perhaps it has housed one man, which is enough. Look about you, Watson, observe.
0.200: What?
5.980: The lantern light revealed a chamber carved by nature, yet altered by human hand, heist.
3.380: Iron rods were fixed in the rock, supporting lengths of wire and tubing.
3.640: At one side lay a crude apparatus of bellows, pipes and a speaking trumpet,
2.900: all cunningly arranged to project sound through the waterfall itself.
3.240: Then it is true, the voices of the falls were but trickery.
3.360: Ingenious trickery, designed to play upon superstition.
6.440: Observe also these chains and manacles fixed to the wall, tools of coercion.
6.180: Our murderer lured or dragged his victims here, bound them and then cast them into the torrent.
1.860: Fiendish! But to what end?
3.400: Patience, Watson. Motive must soon declare itself.
3.840: Yet I suspect it lies in the inheritance of the Stanhope estate.
2.140: Someone profits by the deaths.
5.440: Even as he spoke, a faint sound reached us above the roar, a scrape of stone, a breath.
3.680: Holmes extinguished the lantern with a swift motion, plunging us into darkness.
1.320: We crouched in silence.
4.280: Presently, a figure entered the cavern from a hidden side passage, bearing a lantern of his own.
4.100: In its glow, we beheld a face twisted with malice, the face of Colonel Stanhope Stewart,
2.880: Samuel Price, whom we had been told was the first victim.
0.980: Holmes, he lives.
0.700: Hush, Watson.
5.200: The man moved to the apparatus, adjusted the tubes and then spoke into the trumpet
5.360: A ghastly wailing issued forth, magnified by the falls, echoing like the voices of the dead
4.100: Another soul for the torrent, another offering to the curse
6.280: At this, Holmes sprang forward, striking the lantern from the fellow's hand and seizing him by the collar
4.440: I rushed to his aid and together we bore the struggling wretch to the ground
5.100: So, Samuel Price, the ghost returns to life
2.760: Your masquerade is at an end
3.120: Curse you, Holmes, you meddling devil
2.160: Spare your curses
3.060: Explain rather how you contrived your false death
3.140: I left my coat and boots at the falls
2.380: Let the villagers think I'd been taken
2.360: Then I had freedom to work unseen
3.540: They all feared this curse too much to search closely
2.560: Clever, but your purpose?
0.440: Purpose?
0.180: Huh
1.320: The colonel's estate
1.680: Lands rich in tin and copper
1.840: He would not exploit them
1.660: But I knew their worth
1.200: With each death
1.220: The villagers' terror grew
0.960: And soon
1.980: Even Stanhope himself would have fled
1.940: The hall would fall into ruin
1.580: The land into my hands
0.760: Mine
1.860: Oh, you madman
1.680: You murdered innocents for gain
1.500: They were nothing
0.820: Peasants
0.720: A clerk
1.040: The curate's boy
1.180: I needed their debts
1.400: to keep the legend alive.
2.520: And so you cloaked greed in superstition.
1.480: But you overreached, Price.
1.640: Had you not slain the boy,
3.580: suspicion might never have turned upon the living steward.
1.620: Holmes bound the fellow swiftly
2.820: with the very chains he had prepared for his victims.
1.220: We dragged him to the entrance,
1.600: where the storm had somewhat abated,
2.100: and by dawn delivered him into the hands of
1.940: Colonel Stanhope and the village constable.
1.740: Price, my own steward,
5.020: the man I trusted above all, to think such villainy lurked beneath my roof.
5.680: Do not reproach yourself, Colonel. The most venomous snake often wears the smoothest skin.
6.580: Yet the truth is laid bare at last. Mr. Holmes, you have freed us. The curse is broken.
7.820: Nay, Miss Stanhope, the curse never was. Only man's deception, now unmasked. Remember well,
2.480: Superstition is but the veil
2.600: By which the wicked hide their craft
2.060: The villagers rejoiced
1.660: As though a plague had been lifted
2.800: Yet I could not forget the faces of those poor souls
2.460: Whose lives had been sacrificed to Price's greed
1.540: Holmes, however, remained calm
2.580: Smoking his pipe as we journeyed back toward London
1.660: You astonish me, Holmes
3.360: From the first, you suspected mortal hands rather than spectral
1.860: Yet how could you be certain?
1.380: Because, my dear Watson
2.080: Nature is consistent
10.080: water falls rocks endure winds blow but when men die by identical means time after time then man
9.700: not nature is at work to assume otherwise is to abandon reason how gone sir and the voices the
7.820: the supposed curse all contrived elementary optical and acoustic effects watson heightened
6.560: by cunning contrivances. A lantern placed cunningly here, a tube concealed there,
5.540: enough to deceive the ignorant, but not, I trust, a student of deduction.
5.560: Thus ended the mystery of the cursed waterfall. Yet though the apparatus was dismantled and the
4.840: murderer brought to justice, the roar of those falls haunts me still, and whenever I recall the
5.040: silver spray shining in the moonlight, I see again the torched figure of my friend striding fearless
4.640: into peril, armed with nothing but his reason and conquering even the darkest superstition
5.080: with the light of truth. It was with immense relief that I found myself once more in the
5.660: comfort of our lodgings at 221 B Bake. Hmm, our street, hmm? The cracking of the fire,
5.280: the rattle of handsome gabs upon Baker Street below, and the aromatic haze of Holmes's tobacco
5.260: combined to assure me that the world had resumed its proper order. Yet my thoughts lingered upon
4.980: Devonshire, upon the roaring torrent and the shadowy cavern where death had so long held
5.580: dominion. Holmes sat opposite me, stretched languidly in his chair, his eyes half closed,
4.640: his long fingers steeper together. One might have thought him the very picture of indolence.
4.320: Were it not for the faint glimmer of amusement that laid upon his lips, I knew that expression
5.100: well. It signified that my friend awaited my inevitable questions, as a schoolmaster awaits
5.720: the pupil's stumbling recitation. Holmes, I confess myself bewildered still. You sought
4.480: through the deception from the first, while I, and indeed the entire countryside, remained
5.040: convinced of supernatural agency. Cammy, how did you so quickly discard the idea of a curse?
6.920: Because, Watson, curses are the province of the imagination, not of fact. I reason thus,
5.940: either the waterfall is in itself an agent of death, in which case the accidents would be
6.200: random and varied, or else some intelligence directs the deaths, in which case they will be
8.000: uniform and purposeful. The three victims perished in identical fashion, struck upon the rocks below.
7.120: Therefore the agency was human. Yet surely the glowing spray, the voices, the taints of villagers,
6.680: these were convincing enough to any rational mind. Convincing to any mind that relies upon
7.080: impression rather than analysis. Consider, moonlight upon spray will always produce
8.200: spectral effects. As for voices, we have long known the capacity of tubes and trumpets to project
6.440: sound. Behold my remark about the ink-drought in the Colonel's letter, the agitation of a man of
7.220: discipline. That agitation spoke of mortal terror, not of fanciful curse. Once you have eliminated
5.560: the impossible, Watson. Whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
2.660: Then the steward, Bryce, was your suspect from the first.
6.860: Not my suspect, but my hypothesis. The fact that his death was unconfirmed,
8.440: that no body had been recovered, at once roused my suspicion. Villagers are prone to hysteria,
2.700: and a coat and boots upon the rocks
1.500: suffice to convince them.
3.640: Yet absence of evidence is not evidence of death.
1.880: Thus I reserved judgment
2.520: until the cavern revealed itself.
1.620: I could not but admire the clarity
1.860: with which he expounded these matters.
1.580: Yet there lingered in me a question
2.260: that touched not on logic but on humanity.
1.760: Holmes, do you feel no outrage
1.200: at the cruelty of the man?
2.520: Those poor souls, lured to death for greed,
2.140: Does not such wickedness stir you to anger?
0.980: Anger clouds.
0.780: Judgment, Watson.
1.580: I prefer cold detachment.
4.220: Thrice is but one more specimen for the cabinet of human folly.
4.180: His avarice, his cunning, his exploitation of superstition,
2.960: all instructive, all lamentably predictable.
4.040: If his crimes excite me at all, it is only as material for study.
1.500: The law will punish him.
5.080: My concern is merely to ensure that the facts are clear.
1.400: And yet, Melistan hope.
5.040: Ah, yes, a sensitive soul, torn between loyalty and suspicion.
1.620: She guessed more than she admitted.
4.560: But her silence was born of filial duty, not guilt.
2.600: I trust she will recover her peace,
3.440: now that the shadow has lifted from her father's house.
6.580: I pondered his words in silence. In his left, to me, the case was filled with human tragedy and pathos.
2.340: To Holmes, it was but a demonstration of principles.
4.980: Yet perhaps it was this wedding detachment that allowed him to pierce the veil of deceit when others faltered.
3.740: One lesson I draw from this, Holmes, is how perilous superstition can be.
5.040: Honest men and women, driven by fear of a phantom, allowed themselves to be blinded to the truth.
9.120: Exactly so. Superstition is but the abdication of reason. A cunning rogue has but to whisper
7.680: of a curse, and men will see ghosts where there are only shadows, hear voices where there is only
7.600: wind, and yield their judgment into another's hands. You, Watson, as a medical man, must combat
6.140: such weakness as surely as I combat crime. Science is the antidote to fear.
4.600: He rose and paced the room, his dressing gown flowing about him like a scholar's robe,
5.620: his voice animated now with that peculiar energy which seized him whenever a case had
6.120: reached its conclusion. Observe the progression, Watson. First, the legend of the gypsy woman,
7.640: of fertile soil into this soil. Price sought terror by feigning his own death. Next he
7.280: contrived voices by means of tubes, and spectral light by lantern and moon. Then emboldened he
5.800: struck down those who strayed near the falls, thus strengthening the illusion of supernatural
8.940: vengeance. It is the very anatomy of fraud, legend, illusion, and murder, each feeding upon
5.900: the last. And yet, but for your intervention, he might have succeeded. The colonel might have
7.300: abandoned his estate, and price seized his mineral riches. True, but fraud always contains the seed
7.840: of its own destruction. Trice grew reckless, and in slaying the curate's son, he provoked inquiry
8.800: from outside. Thus, crime ever defeats itself in the end. I sat long into the night, after Holmes
4.940: had retired, reflecting upon the strange adventure we had shared, ticked in the roar of the waterfall,
4.840: I seemed still to hear the cries of the victims, yet mingled with them was the calm voice of Holmes,
5.800: dissecting illusion with scalpel-like precision. And I thought to myself that if ever posterity
5.000: should know of these adventures, it must know not only the triumphs of reason, but also the
5.220: shadows of human passion, against which reason contends. For though Holmes was right to dismiss
5.320: the curse as fiction, the fear it inspired was no less real, and in that fear lay tragedy.
4.420: Thus I set pen to paper to record the case of the cursed waterfall, hoping that it may stand as
4.880: both a warning and a lesson, a warning against the dangers of credulity, and a lesson in the
6.380: power of clear deduction. Horms, I murmured at last, as sleep stole over me. It is indeed as you
5.340: say, everything is elementary, when once you show the chain, this, but for me, the word will always
3.760: hold mysteries, so long as men are moved by terror and by greed.
3.220: Then Watson came his voice from the shadows.
4.500: The world shall never lack for work for you and me.
5.100: And with that, the fire sank low, the city outside hummed on, and another chapter closed
1.400: in the chroniclers of Sherlock Holmes.
