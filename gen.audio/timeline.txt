5.440: It is an oft-forgotten truth that the most singular of my friend's adventures did not always arrive,
3.620: upon his desk, by telegram, or through some noble client at the door.
5.680: Frequently, they entered our lives by the oddest of chances, like trifles, dropped in the gutter,
2.990: which to ordinary eyes would seem beneath consideration.
6.050: It was one such trifle, in the form of a goose and an old hat, that ushered in the affair of the blue carbuncle.
3.780: The morning was bitterly cold. Snow lay upon the streets of London,
3.120: and the fog of December plunged to the lamps like a shroud,
3.790: I had determined, after a quiet breakfast at my Kensington lodging,
3.590: to call upon my old companion and wish him the compliments of the season.
4.460: I confess, too, that I had a desire to see what strange humour possessed him,
2.670: for when Sherlock Holmes passed his time in idleness,
3.260: he was a sore trial to himself and to his friends.
3.340: Arriving at Baker Street, I found him, as so often before,
3.250: lounging in his dressing gown, armed with a pipe-curling blue smoke,
4.420: Above his head, an eye is fixed in contemplative absorption upon some object to study.
1.240: But what object?
4.530: Not the lens and retort of chemistry, nor the revolver which he deemed with military precision,
3.750: but a broken old hat, weather-stained and battered beyond polite use.
4.090: Beside it, most curiously, lay a large Christmas goose upon a tree.
5.180: My dear Holmes, said I, placing my gloves upon the mantle, what mischief is this?
3.120: I had thought to find you deep in monograph or experiment,
3.320: yet you sit gazing at a hat as though it were the crown of England.
7.110: Not mischief, Watson, knowledge, replied he, lifting the object with a delicate forefinger.
4.780: To your unpracticed eye it is but an old felt hat.
6.730: To mine it is a record of its owner's character, habits, fortune, and misfortune.
4.850: Every crease tells a story, every stain is a word upon a page.
3.660: It is, if you like, a novel written in felt.
4.970: I laughed. Come, Holmes, you cannot pretend you can deduce more than that.
4.610: Some poor fellow has lost both supper and headgear upon a frosty night.
5.860: On the contrary, he said, with that quiet confidence I had come to know so well.
7.860: Fyhead, this hat is full of suggestion. Observe the size, Watson. Large, very large.
9.190: Its owner is a man of considerable brain, and yet see the discoloured lining, the frayed edges.
4.370: He has fallen on evil days, though once of good station.
2.340: There is dust here, but no polish.
6.200: He does not brush it as once he did, yet he tries to maintain appearances.
4.120: A moral man, striving against adversity.
2.100: Really, Holmes, this is too much.
2.680: You speak as though you had lived a year with the fellow.
2.190: It is elementary.
4.270: Note again, the hat has a loop for securing a strap,
2.580: but the strap is missing.
1.180: Careless.
3.750: Yet the brim is not torn, so he is not a man of violence.
3.020: There are the faintest traces of hair oil.
3.330: He has tried to dress respectably for some occasion,
3.130: though not lately, for the oil is stale.
2.450: His wife no longer attends to him,
7.220: else she would keep him better groomed hence domestic separation from all this i pictured
6.980: a once prosperous man fallen into hard times self-respecting still but slackening under
6.440: misfortune homes you astound me if all this be true the man is half revealed to us already
6.720: tin but what of the goose surely that cannot speak the goose speaks less clearly but speaks
6.160: nonetheless, Holmes said, touching its breast. It was fattened in the country and sent up to
5.820: town for the holiday. Our friend Peterson, the commissioner, acquired both bird and hat last
6.140: night when some roughs set upon the fellow at Dotnum Court Road. The man defended himself,
6.660: dropped his goose, lost his hat, and fled. Peterson, being honest, brought both here.
5.940: Very commendable of him, yet hardly the stuff of an investigation worthy of your talents
5.360: Holmes leaned back, pipe smoke wreathed about his sharp profile
3.320: My dear Watson, you missed the spot
5.500: Here we have a fragment of a life and from it we may reconstruct the whole
6.060: Even if the case leads us no further than the kitchen, it will amuse my powers of deduction
7.380: He chuckled, and I could not but join in his humour, though I felt that my friend was wasting himself upon trifles.
7.830: Still, I had learnt never to doubt his instinct, for more than once had an apparently trivial circumstance unfolded into the gravest of crimes.
7.520: We were yet speaking, when the door opened and Peterson himself appeared, a stout, honest fellow, his face a girl with excitement.
5.290: He carried under his arm the velly goose which had lain upon the tray, but now gutted and plucked.
3.510: Beg pardon, Mr. Holmes, but look here, sir.
2.800: When my wife was cleaning the goose for roasting,
2.480: she found this inside the crop.
3.110: From his pocket, he drew a small leather case
3.320: and from the case, a glittering stone of such deep blue
3.480: that it seemed to hold the light of heaven within its facets.
3.650: Even I, no expert in gems, could not mistake its worth.
1.890: Holmes uttered a cry of satisfaction
1.960: and held the jewel up to the window
3.380: where the winter sunlight broke it into a thousand fires.
5.560: By the Lord Peterson, you have stumbled upon the adventure of the season.
3.230: This is the blue carbuncle itself.
6.870: The blue carbuncle, I exclaimed, surely not the very gem which was stolen from the Countess of Morka's hotel suite last week.
1.280: It was in every paper.
1.050: King of God?
1.330: The same, Watson.
4.300: The most precious stone in Europe, valued at more than two thousand pounds.
3.940: A gem with a history written in blood and lust.
8.160: and now, mirabile dictu, it turns up inside the crop of a Christmas goose left upon my hearth.
3.940: What are we to do, sir? It is no trifle to hold such a treasure.
4.540: Do, my good fellow, we shall restore it to its rightful owner.
5.440: But, the question, the delicious question is how it passed from a lady's jewel case
2.220: into the stomach of your goose.
5.490: That is the chain of reasoning which we must now unravel.
5.500: Holmes, said I, at last I see the worth of your hat and goose.
2.660: This promises to be a case indeed.
2.060: Holmes's eyes deemed.
4.130: Yes, Watson, a case worthy of our best efforts.
3.860: The adventure of the blue carbuncle has begun.
4.620: And so, from a frosty street fight, a broken hat and an oddery goose,
4.280: there opened before us a tale as strange as any in the chronicles of Baker Street.
4.020: The sight of that remarkable stone clittering upon Holmes' palm
2.910: changed the whole complexion of the, hmm, affair.
2.520: Hmm, what had seemed a trivial curiosity.
3.410: The battered hat, the battered hat, the abandoned goose
4.460: were suddenly revealed as the key to a crime which had shaken all of London.
3.410: I confess my heart quickened, for though I am a man of medicine,
3.330: not prone to superstition, it felt as though fate herself
4.600: had placed the blue carbuncle in our very rooms, demanding explanation.
4.030: Holmes rose from his chair with the air of a general setting troops upon the march.
4.000: He paced before the fire, the jewels still twinkling between finger and thumb,
2.240: while Peterson stood dumbfounded.
4.170: Peterson, you have acted with admirable honesty.
3.120: You will take this stone at once to Scotland Yard
4.080: and hand it over with a statement of how it came into your possession.
3.380: But stay, you shall first leave the goose.
6.410: It is no longer of service to me, and your family shall enjoy it for supper.
3.760: As for the hat, I shall keep it for the present.
5.210: Very good, sir. But what of the man who dropped them? Ought we not to advertise?
7.330: Patience, my good fellow. We shall trace the true owner soon enough. Leave that part to me.
5.790: Peterson bowed and withdrew, clutching the goose, his expression, a mixture of bewilderment and pride.
6.130: When the door had closed, Holmes tossed the gem lightly into the air and caught it again with the dexterity of a juggler.
2.810: There lies our problem, Watson.
8.910: How did the blue carbuncle find its way from the Countess of Morcar's jewel case into the throat of a Christmas goose?
5.800: It was stolen, you recall, from her hotel suite at the Cosmopolitan.
1.630: I heard...
7.700: A plumber named John Horner was arrested on suspicion for he had been working in the room.
5.220: But the case against him is weak, resting chiefly on the word of the Countess's maid.
2.910: The gem was not found in his possession.
4.500: He lies now in Gale protesting innocence.
4.100: Then the matter is not so settled as the papers would have us believe?
2.610: Hmm, far from it.
0.440: Hmm.
7.180: Horner is an ill-starred creature, with a record for petty theft, yet I cannot believe he engineered
7.120: so daring a robbery. No, Watson, the truth is subtler. As always, we must follow the trail
6.860: of the goose. For, mark you, the bird is not a common fowl, but one brought specially from a
6.320: club. The Alpha Inn, to be precise. Peterson's man heard the fellow who lost it. Say so,
1.530: during the scuffle.
1.500: The Alpha Inn.
1.670: Then by tracing the supply of geese
0.980: to that establishment,
2.150: we may reach the mysterious owner.
1.460: Precisely.
1.560: You see the game, Watson.
2.350: From the Alpha, we trace the supplier.
2.050: From the supplier, the breeder.
3.150: And till at last we reach the source.
2.170: And somewhere along that path,
1.550: we shall meet the man
2.160: who placed a priceless stone
2.980: into the crop of a Christmas goose.
2.140: That, my dear friend,
2.980: is a man I intend to know.
2.520: I could not restrain a laugh of admiration
1.720: at the audacity of the plan.
1.380: Holmes, with his usual energy,
1.570: donned his coat and muffler.
3.220: Holmes, surely you do not mean to set forth immediately?
1.550: The streets are thick with snow
2.160: and you have not yet breakfasted.
2.410: My breakfast can wait.
2.560: Adventure is the best stimulant.
2.740: Come, Watson, your company is essential.
1.570: I have always said,
2.500: you are the whetstone upon which
2.670: I sharpened my deductions.
3.230: Flattered, I wrapped myself in my own heavy greatcoat
2.470: and me sallied forth into the biting wind.
2.060: The Alpha Inn stood in Bloomsbury,
1.540: a respectable public house,
1.830: frequented by tradesmen and clerks.
3.120: Within it was warm with firelight and the smell of ale.
1.900: Behind the bar stood a portly landlord
1.840: who regarded Holmes with surprise
2.700: as he strode in with his usual delectness.
3.960: You supplied geese to your members at this season?
1.340: That's right, sir.
2.330: Each man may take his word for Christmas.
1.370: Excellent.
4.710: Could you oblige me by telling me to whom this particular goose belonged?
7.040: Well, now that would be Mr. Henry Baker, tall gentleman, thin, red nose, wore a tattered hat.
4.060: He took his goose, but from what I hear, lost it in a scuffle outside.
1.650: A shame, too.
1.430: Indeed?
2.960: And do you have Mr. Baker's address?
1.550: I'm afraid not.
4.200: He's but a casual member, but he'll be back, no doubt, for his ale.
1.410: What do you ask?
2.670: Merely to restore his property.
1.800: Thank you, my good sir.
2.620: You have rendered me a service.
4.480: So, back upon the snowy street, Holmes' eyes gleamed with triumph.
3.590: You perceive, Watson, we now hold the thread.
6.250: The hat, the goose, the landlord's description all point to one Henry Baker.
4.610: We must advertise his discovery in the evening papers.
4.760: Should he present himself, we shall test the truth of my deductions.
3.960: But if he be innocent, Holmes, what danger to him in coming forward?
1.610: None whatever.
2.600: If guilty, he will never appear.
2.500: That, too, will tell us much.
2.640: Either way, we advance.
3.000: Thus resolved, we returned to Baker Street,
2.520: where Holmes composed a notice for the evening editions,
5.670: offering that the finder of a lost goose and hat might recover them by applying to 221B.
2.360: The day passed in anxious expectation.
4.620: I confess I spent the hours in speculation, turning over Holmes' deductions in my mind.
4.880: Evening fell, lamps were lit, and at last a timid ring echoed upon the stair.
2.130: Holmes sprang to his feet.
5.400: A fish bites, Watson. Let us see what manner of man Henry Baker may be.
3.660: Inshuffled, a tall, thin fellow, his nose red from drink,
2.140: his clothes threadbare yet respectable.
1.740: He bowed with nervous dignity.
2.400: Good evening, gentlemen.
3.390: I believe you have advertised concerning a goose and a hat.
2.230: I am the unfortunate owner.
2.350: Pray be seated, Mr. Baker.
3.760: Here is your hat, somewhat the worse for its adventures.
5.910: And as for the goose, I regret to say it has already been consumed.
3.720: Eaten, sir? Then what remains for me?
2.810: Fear not. We are men of honour.
5.160: Permit me to offer you another bird of equal weight and quality.
4.160: Why, sir, you overwhelm me. I thank you most sincerely.
4.300: One question only. Did you purchase the goose yourself?
3.950: No, sir. It was given to the Alpha Inn.
4.360: Each year, they distribute geese among members, and this was mine.
2.660: Beyond that, I know nothing.
3.040: I see. Then you are satisfied?
3.160: Entirely. You have been most generous.
2.540: With another bow, the poor fellow departed,
2.200: bearing his replacement goose under his arm.
3.250: Holmes watched him go with an expression of keen amusement.
1.740: Then he is innocent?
3.180: Clearly, he knew nothing of the jewel.
2.100: His gratitude was genuine.
3.130: The carbuncle passed through his hands by accident.
0.780: Oh!
4.220: Our task now is to trace it further back
3.190: to the supplier of the Alpha's geese.
1.740: Combs consulted his note,
2.150: then seized hat and coat once more.
3.530: Come, Watson, the chase grows hot.
1.630: We must find this supplier
2.880: or the blue carbuncle may vanish once more
2.250: into the shadows of London.
3.190: And so, into the frosty night we plunged again,
2.120: little knowing that the path of the goose
2.640: would lead us deeper into the dens of crime
2.050: than either of us expected.
3.770: If part one of this adventure was remarkable for its trifling beginnings
2.690: and part two for its sudden leap into significance,
3.360: then part three may be said to contain the very marrow of pursuit.
2.610: For here we followed the trail of the goose step by step
2.040: through the labyrinthine commerce of London
2.900: until we came face to face with the heart of the riddle.
3.620: After dismissing poor Henry Baker, Holmes wasted no time.
3.040: His eyes glittered with that peculiar excitement
3.100: which I had seen only when the game was afoot.
5.580: He took down his notebook, scribbled the name of the Alpha Inn supplier and declared our next port of call.
11.450: The Alpha Inn received their geese from one Breckenridge, a porterer in Covent Garden, a man of brusque manner, but extensive trade.
4.470: If the birds did not originate with him, he can direct us further.
3.870: Come, Watson, there is not an hour to be lost.
2.570: Holmes, you drive us like sleuth-hounds.
4.730: But do you truly expect a porterer to recall the source of a single goose amidst so many?
5.760: You forget, my dear fellow, that this is not any goose but one of a particular batch,
1.870: threatened for the holiday trade.
5.350: In such cases, the chain of custody is short and distinct.
5.630: It is a matter of following the thread backward until it reaches the spindle.
5.730: We set off at once, and soon the rattle of handsome weeds carried us into the heart of Covent Garden.
4.530: The market was alive with cries of traders, the smell of straw and poultry,
3.630: and the chatter of buyers haggling beneath the flickering gas lamps.
4.140: Amidst the din stood Breckenridge's stall, piled high with birds and game,
3.870: the man himself a red-faced fellow with sleeves rolled high.
6.070: Good evening, Mr. Breckenridge. I understand you supplied geese to the Alpha Inn.
1.430: That's right, sir.
1.740: What of it?
4.970: If it's a complaint about the quality, you'll find none better in the market.
2.510: No complaint, but curiosity.
3.670: Could you inform me from whom you purchased those geese?
3.360: Now look here, sir. That's my business.
2.710: Do you take me for a gossiping old woman?
3.220: I sell to whom I please, and from whom I please,
2.680: and I'll not be pestered by busybodies.
3.460: Come, my good man, it is of no consequence to you.
3.250: My friend only wishes to trace a bird to its source.
3.360: Then he may trace it elsewhere, for I'll not tell him a word.
4.810: I've had enough of inquisitive fellows sniffing about my geese all day.
3.430: First a tall chap in a flat cap, now you two.
3.370: What's in those birds, eh? Gold sovereigns?
5.100: Something of greater value, perhaps, said Holmes softly.
2.880: But Breckenridge folded his arms obstinately,
2.920: and no amount of persuasion would use in his tongue.
6.160: No! Holmes regarded him with a twinkle, then suddenly proposed a wager on the weight of one of the birds.
3.940: Poulterer, whose pride was touched, entered eagerly into the bet.
3.090: Holmes lost intentionally, paying the man a sovereign.
2.420: This act mollified him considerably.
5.000: Now, Breckenridge, said Holmes, pocketing his empty purse,
3.910: I have been fairly beaten, and I hold no grudge.
4.240: But tell me, who has been asking you questions about those geese?
5.930: A rough fellow, name of Ryder, works at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.
4.330: He came prying about not two hours ago, wanting to know who bought a certain bird.
2.930: When I would say, he grew hot under the collar.
2.210: That's all I know, and enough too.
2.710: Ryder, you say? Excellent!
3.440: And these geese, where did you obtain them originally?
4.170: From a dealer named Mrs. Oapshot, down by Brixton.
3.990: She rears birds, and I take her stock every year.
3.300: You have been most helpful, Mr. Breckenridge.
2.250: I thank you for your candor.
3.280: We withdrew, Holmes smiling at my bewildered expression.
1.740: Holmes, who is this Ryder,
3.130: and what interest can a hotel commissioner have in geese?
3.170: My dear Watson, you forget your newspapers.
3.800: Ryder is head attendant at the Cosmopolitan,
4.230: the very hotel where the blue carbuncle was stolen.
2.150: If he is sniffing after geese,
2.400: I should wager a month's pension.
3.960: He knows more of the jewel than he has yet confessed.
2.450: Then we are closing upon our quarry.
4.620: Step by step, from the Alpha to Breckenridge,
4.100: from Breckenridge to Oakshot, from Oakshot to Ryder.
2.580: The line tightens like a snare.
2.240: Come, Watson, we must see this.
2.060: Mrs. Oakshot at once.
2.570: It was a long, cold drive to Brixton,
3.240: the snow whirling about our cab like a host of phantom riders,
5.080: When at last we reached the humble dwelling of Mrs. Oakshott, we found the shutters closed
4.030: and no one within save a maid who informed us that her mistress was absent.
4.010: Disappointed, Holmes left a note and we turned back toward Baker Street.
5.250: We had scarcely arrived, however, when our landlady ushered in a man whose agitation was plain.
4.370: He was tall, sharp, featured, with restless eyes and trembling hands.
4.080: Holmes glanced at me and I saw the spark of recognition leap in his face.
7.520: Ah, Mr. Ryder, I believe you come upon business connected with a goose?
5.690: Yes, sir, yes indeed. I heard you had advertised concerning one. I wish to inquire.
6.190: Compose yourself, sir. Be seated. You are head attendant at the Cosmopolitan, I think?
4.900: ...
1.100: That's right, sir.
5.320: And your interest in geese is not entirely professional?
4.430: Aye, well, it was my sister who bred the birds, Mrs. Oakshott of Brixton.
3.020: One of them, a fine white goose, came into your hands by chance.
4.260: I would be most obliged if you could return it to me, for it was not mine to give.
5.080: Alas, my dear rider, that goose has already been eaten.
2.960: Eaten? Then all is lost.
3.870: His cry was so full of despair that I started from my chair.
5.010: forms, however, remained composed, his eyes fixed like steel upon the trembling man.
4.550: Not all, Ryder. The stone you placed within it is safe.
4.680: At these words, the man leapt from his seat, his face blanched to the colour of ashes,
2.040: and he staggered as though struck.
3.050: Stone? You know, then, you have it?
3.090: Yes, the blue carbuncle is recovered.
4.080: The only question is, what am I to do with you, James Ryder?
7.170: And so the net drew tight, and the mystery of goose and jewel stood revealed in terrible clarity.
4.090: The trembling figure of James Ryder stood before us, his lips quivering,
5.070: his gaze darting from Holmes' calm face to mine as though searching for mercy.
4.550: A secret of the blue carbuncle had been dragged from its hiding place at last,
4.740: and we were now to hear the tale of villainy that had so strangely intersected with a Christmas goose.
2.360: compose yourself rider
2.140: Holmes said with quiet authority
2.380: you are in the presence of friends
2.380: if you choose to act wisely
1.880: but conceal nothing
2.000: for I know too much already
3.560: you know everything sir
0.660: he stammered
1.220: he stammered
2.240: enough to hang you
2.120: if I chose to hand you over
1.720: but it is my practice
1.760: to hear a man's own account
0.960: before judgment
1.600: sit down there
1.880: upon the chair by the fire,
5.280: and tell us truly how the blue carbuncle came into your possession.
1.930: Ryder collapsed into the chair,
1.480: burying his face in his hands.
2.170: His shoulders shook as if he would weep.
2.890: At length he spoke, in a broken voice.
2.700: It was greed, sir, nothing but greed.
1.750: I'd long been tempted by the stone,
1.720: hearing it was worth thousands.
2.320: Cuffering Cusack, the maid to the countess,
2.640: whispered to me that the jewel lay in her mistress's jewel case,
1.930: and that the countess was careless of her keys.
1.100: We found a wicked plan.
2.390: I was to steal it, and together, me would profit.
4.060: I swear to you, sir, I had never done a thing so bold before.
2.120: Yet you did it, Ryder.
1.020: Tell us how.
2.960: ..
1.230: On the night of the robbery,
3.620: one of the plumber was sent to repair the grid in the countess's room.
2.900: Catherine and I contrived it so that suspicion should fall upon him.
2.250: While he worked, I slipped into the chamber on some pretense,
1.640: opened the case, and pocketed the stone.
1.640: Then I raised a cry.
2.970: Catherine supported me, and the poor fellow was accused.
3.430: Oh, sir, I never thought it would go so far as prison for him.
2.210: You miserable wretch, I exclaimed.
4.520: The man lies now in Gaol, his character ruined all through your villainy.
3.150: Peace, Watson, let him tell the whole.
1.720: And what then, Ryder?
3.280: I hid the stone, but I feared the police would search me.
1.690: I knew not where to hide it.
2.150: In my terror, I fled to my sister's house.
2.720: Mrs. Oakshot in Brixton, she breeds geese for the market.
1.740: An idea struck me mad desperate.
4.320: it. I forced open the crop of one fine bird and thrust the stone inside. I thought to recover it
6.500: later, when suspicion had abated. And thus the goose became the hiding place of a gem worth the
8.340: kingdom. Ingenious, yet foolish. Continue. I marked the bird with a small tag, so I should know it
4.620: again. But alas, in the confusion of sending them to Breckenridge's store, my goose was mixed with
5.460: the rest. I begged him, paid him, threatened him to tell me where it went. He refused. Now you say
1.220: it has been eaten.
1.790: Eaten, yes,
2.360: but not before its secret was discovered.
2.370: Your clever stratagem betrayed you, rider.
2.700: ..
2.190: At this the man broke into sobs,
1.860: wringing his hands like a child.
1.510: O Sardar, pity on me.
2.010: If I go to prison, it will be my ruin.
1.830: I shall never hold up my head again.
1.740: My father would die of shame.
1.840: Spare me this once, and I swear on my soul
1.380: I shall never err again.
3.400: I confess my own heart softened at the pitiful sight.
1.560: At the pitiful sight!
4.010: Here was no hardened criminal, but a weak man driven by temptation,
1.840: now crumbling beneath its weight.
2.530: Yet justice, I felt, must be served.
2.380: Holmes, surely this man deserves the law.
2.540: What of poor Horner, languishing in gaol?
6.140: Ah, Watson, there you touch the kernel of the matter, said Holmes gravely.
3.160: It is one thing to pity a trembling coward,
3.380: but another to let an innocent man suffer in his place.
6.760: Reader, do you realize that by your falsehood another man stands upon the brink of ruin?
1.780: I know, sir, I know.
2.110: I shall go to the police, confess all.
2.250: Only do not drag me there like a thief in the night.
1.740: Give me a chance to make it right.
3.120: Would you indeed confess if I left you free?
5.640: Or would you slink away and let Horner rot while you sought safety abroad?
2.930: No, sir, by heaven I swear I would confess.
2.750: Horns regarded him long, his face inscrutable.
4.810: The only sound was the crackle of the fire and Ryder's stifled sobs.
2.020: At last Holmes turned to me.
1.870: What say you, Watson?
3.580: Shall we hand him to the law or trust to his conscience?
3.370: I hesitated, torn between indignation and pity.
2.210: Holmes, he's weak rather than wicked.
2.470: Yet if we let him go, justice is mocked.
3.200: Still, I cannot bring myself to demand the gall for him.
2.890: Perhaps mercy may do more than punishment in such a case.
2.300: So, Holmes nodded slowly.
9.260: So be it. Ryder, you are free. The stone is restored. I shall see that Horner's case is
7.260: reconsidered and the truth revealed in such a manner as to exonerate him without dragging your
7.260: name before the world. But mark me well. If ever you stray again, I shall not lift a finger to save
7.020: you. Oh, sir, you are an angel. I shall mend my ways. I shall indeed. With a cry half of gratitude,
5.860: half of terror, the man fled from the room, leaving us in silence. Holmes, do you think it
5.980: wise to let him go? What if he offends again? I think not, Watson. That trembling creature
6.880: is not made for a life of crime. Prison would harden him, but freedom may reform him. Besides,
6.700: he smiled faintly. Christmas is a season of forgiveness. I gazed at him with admiration,
4.880: as I had done so often before, for on his cold reason, Sherlock Holmes possessed a heart not
5.040: untouched by human kindness. And so, while the snow still lay upon London streets, the adventure
5.050: of the blue carbuncle drew toward its end, leaving me with thoughts upon crime, justice and mercy,
5.670: which no medical textbook could ever have taught. Thus ended the most curious of cases, brought to
4.850: us not by client or constable, but by the chance abandonment of a goose and a battered old hat.
4.730: As Ryder's footsteps faded upon the stairs, silence fell over the sitting room of Baker Street.
4.110: The fire burned low and the shadows flickered across Holmes' thoughtful face.
4.110: Asshole! I sat opposite him, turning the matter over in my mind.
5.400: Holmes, said I at last, you astonish me. I had thought your duty was always to the law,
2.340: yet you have let a criminal slip through your fingers.
5.400: Not always to the law, Watson, he replied, knocking the ash from his pipe.
6.010: The law is a blunt instrument, and sometimes justice lies in a gentler hand.
6.170: Ida is not a hardened villain, but a weak man who stumbled to send him to Gaul
4.010: would serve neither society nor his soul.
4.170: He will never forget the terror of this night.
2.040: But what of John Horner, the plumber?
1.790: Will he remain accused?
5.850: I shall see to it that the charge collapses without rider's testimony.
2.580: The case against him cannot stand.
4.460: The countess will regain her stone and the innocent man will go free.
2.300: ..
2.140: That is enough.
4.740: Yet the countess herself will never know how near she came to losing her jewel forever.
4.900: The great public seldom does know how close it comes to disaster, Watson.
11.500: Quatson, our task is not to trumpet our victories, but to ensure that truth is served, whether in silence or acclaim.
2.220: ..
4.780: He rose and stretched, casting aside his dressing gown for a warmer coat.
8.960: Now, my dear fellow, I believe we have earned a glass of hot punch and perhaps a pipe before bed.
6.220: Let us not allow the affairs of rogues to spoil the remainder of Christmas.
23.780: ............
1.910: in the most humble of places.
3.660: Holmes, perceiving my thoughts, smiled across the lamplight.
5.010: You see, Watson, why I say there is no such thing as a trifle.
4.930: Every incident, however small, may be the starting point of truth.
3.610: The world is full of sermons and stones and stories,
4.040: in hats and geese, if one only learns to read them.
2.180: You are right, Holmes, I replied.
3.760: Once again you have shown me how the extraordinary hides within the ordinary.
3.600: I shall never look upon a Christmas goose in quite the same way.
5.200: Not upon a blue garb, uncle, I trust, he said with a chuckle.
3.070: Outside, the bells of London chimed the hour.
4.380: See, beyond the frosted panes, the city lay hushed beneath its cloak of snow,
3.570: carriages muffled, lamps glowing like faint stars in the fog.
5.000: Within, the fire burned bright, and the strange jewel gleamed once more upon the table
3.450: before being consigned to the safekeeping of Scotland Yard.
3.340: Thus was concluded the adventure of the blue carbuncle.
3.710: It remains in my memory not for the brilliance of Holmes' deductions,
3.080: though they were, as ever, remarkable,
4.710: nor even for the oddity of a priceless stone hidden within a Christmas goose.
3.590: No, it endures because of the lesson my friend imparted that night,
2.240: that mercy can be as just as punishment,
3.470: and that even the keenest of reasoners may temper logic with compassion,
0.880: and in ha!
2.210: In all the years I have known Sherlock Holmes,
4.820: I have seldom seen him more human than when he dismissed James Rider with nothing but a warning
4.460: and though I protested, in my heart I knew he had chosen the better course.
2.640: For the season was Christmas, never wasm
5.090: and if ever there was a time when forgiveness should prevail over vengeance, it was then.
2.700: So ends my account of the singular case,
4.810: which began in laughter over a battered old hat and ended with a glittering stone,
4.420: a trembling thief and the quiet triumph of mercy in the heart of Sherlock Holmes.
