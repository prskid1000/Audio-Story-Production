00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
It is with a peculiar thrill that I commit to paper the strange circumstances

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,060
surrounding what has, see,

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,400
are made to be known in certain musical circles as the song of the vanishing piano.

00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,599
Few events in my long acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,120
demonstrated with such clarity his uncanny method of deduction,

00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:21,440
and few occasions showed more plainly how my own role as humble chronicler

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,019
and fateful companion provided both contrast and completion to that singular intellect.

00:00:26,339 --> 00:00:29,719
The affair began upon one of those damp and sooty evenings in London

00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,879
when the fog seems to press against the windows of Baker Street

00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,539
like a half-conscious spirit demanding admittance.

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,840
The gas lamps flickered in a haze

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,700
and the sound of carriage wheels outside came muffled

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,100
as if London itself were wrapped in cotton.

00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:45,920
Holmes had spent much of the day silent and restless,

00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,840
stretched upon the settee with his long fingers interlaced beneath his chin.

00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:53,219
A familiar sign that his mind was engaged upon some abstract speculation

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,280
had been attempting to digest the medical journal.

00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:58,399
Though truthfully I had read the same page three times without comprehension,

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,079
distracted by the intense stillness of my companion.

00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:05,840
My dear Holmes, you have been staring at that ceiling for the better part of the afternoon.

00:01:06,359 --> 00:01:11,500
I cannot but conclude that some case or perhaps the want of one has occupied your thoughts.

00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:18,480
Elementary Watson, I am, as you say, occupied, but by absence rather than presence.

00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,539
You will observe that the calling card tray upon our mantel is empty and misses.

00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:31,980
Hudson has twice informed us that no visitor has rung at our bell.

00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,100
For three days the stream of human problems has dried to a trickle.

00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:43,380
The city of London has, quite inconsiderately, ceased to be interesting.

00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,360
You astonish me, Holmes.

00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:50,719
Surely the metropolis of severed millions cannot fail to supply intrigue and rhyme even for a single evening.

00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,700
On the contrary, my dear fellow, it can.

00:01:55,299 --> 00:02:00,799
The criminal class is as subject to fatigue as any honest labourer.

00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:05,039
One may as well expect perpetual harvest as perpetual villainy.

00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:11,020
But mark me, when the pendulum ceases to swing, it but gathers force to strike again.

00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,840
I predict that before the night is out, Baker Street will not be so quiet.

00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,159
It was as if the great detective had summoned destiny with his words.

00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,960
For no sooner had he spoken than there came a sharp rap upon the door,

00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:28,580
followed by Mrs. Zondin Hudson's somewhat breathless voice.

00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:34,319
Mr. Holmes, sir, a gentleman to see you says it is most urgent.

00:02:35,199 --> 00:02:39,920
A moment later, into our sitting room stepped a tall and somewhat cadaverous man of middle years,

00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,879
dressed in a frock coat that had clearly seen better days,

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,400
and carrying beneath his arm a folio of sheep music so swollen with loose pages

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,659
that it threatened to scatter its contents upon a heart-thrug.

00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,019
His expression, pale and strained, betrayed an agitation not far from panic.

00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,659
His hair was unkempt, his boots poorly polished,

00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,379
yet his fingers were long, delicate and bore the unmistakable calluses of a musician.

00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,000
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, thank heaven I have found you.

00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,439
My name is Arthur Penfield, late of the Royal Academy of Music.

00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,060
I implore you, sir, to hear my case, but I am on the verge of ruin.

00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,219
You are most welcome, Mr. Penfield.

00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,579
Pray be seated.

00:03:19,099 --> 00:03:22,060
You will find the chair by the fire the most comfortable.

00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:25,259
Allow me to relieve you of your folio.

00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,520
Ah, I perceive it concerns a pianoforte composition, written in your own hand.

00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,120
You are correct, sir, though I marvel how you knew it.

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:44,240
elementary the ink stains upon your right cuff match precisely the fresh notation on the uppermost

00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,259
leaf the nervous tremor in your left hand is not congenital but the result of recent over practice

00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:58,819
upon the keys and your manner of carrying the folio clutched not as an idle portfolio but as a

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,539
Mother clutches a child, speaks of personal authorship.

00:04:03,259 --> 00:04:07,379
The poor man gazed at Holmes with wide eyes, as though confronted by a sorcerer.

00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,299
Then you will understand, sir, how desperate is my plight.

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:18,500
I have written, nay, I had written, a composition intended for public premiere at St. James's Hall next week.

00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,100
It was to be my redemption, my masterwork.

00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:26,019
But last night, in the valley jamo where I lodged, the instrument upon which I composed,

00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:32,379
the pianoforte itself vanished utterly. Vanished, sir, as though the very air had swallowed it.

00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:37,419
Vanished? Surely you mean stolen, or removed by porters during your absence?

00:04:38,359 --> 00:04:43,339
Would that it was so simple, doctor, but I swear to you, and to Mr. Mr. Holmes,

00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,019
that the pianoforte disappeared whilst I sat before it. I had just completed the central

00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:55,279
motif of the second movement when, upon striking the keys, I heard no sound, nothing but silence.

00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,279
I looked down and the keyboard was gone. The lid, the frame, the sounding board all were gone.

00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:07,139
I sat with my hands upon empty air. Only the bench remained beneath me.

00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:13,859
Holmes, who had been listening with eyes half-closed, now leaned forward, every feature alert with interest.

00:05:14,619 --> 00:05:18,459
You say the piano vanished while you were in the act of playing it?

00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:25,839
You perceived no human agency, no movers, no trick of carpentry, no trap-door?

00:05:26,979 --> 00:05:31,479
None, sir. My lodgings are on the third floor of a boarding-house in Bloomsbury.

00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:39,839
The door was locked, the window shut, and yet the instrument, an upright pianoforte of German make, ceased to exist before my eyes.

00:05:40,779 --> 00:05:46,519
My dear Holmes, surely this is a delusion. Our visitor was overwrought, fatigued perhaps from labour at his art.

00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,759
I myself, in medical practice, have known patients who...

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,599
Hush, Watson. Let us never mistake the improbable for the impossible.

00:05:55,219 --> 00:06:00,240
Our client's senses may have deceived him, but we must not permit our reason to do the same.

00:06:00,859 --> 00:06:01,139
Ah!

00:06:01,519 --> 00:06:05,740
Pay continue, Mr. Penfield. Did you at once search the chamber?

00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,599
Indeed I did, sir. I examined every corner, opened the wardrobe, even peered beneath the bed,

00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:14,519
as if a pianoforte might conceal itself there.

00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:16,859
Neighbours heard my outcry and came running.

00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:18,500
They too saw the room,

00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,740
bare save for the stool and the folio upon it.

00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,319
My landlady insists.

00:06:23,799 --> 00:06:24,939
I have gone mad.

00:06:25,339 --> 00:06:26,379
But I swear to you, mister.

00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:26,979
Mister!

00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:31,000
Holmes, the piano was there one instant and gone the next.

00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,500
And the sheet music you carry,

00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:38,279
this was composed upon that same vanished instrument.

00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:40,219
Yes, sir.

00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,959
Every note of it, without the instrument,

00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,979
I cannot refine the piece, nor can I rehearse.

00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:49,919
My reputation and my livelihood both depend upon the concert.

00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:53,379
Unless I recover the Piano Forte, or at the very least,

00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:56,560
solve the riddle of its disappearance, I am undone.

00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:01,839
Holmes rose and paced the room, his long strides carrying him from heart to window and back again.

00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,299
He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then turned to me with a glint in his eye.

00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:09,979
Watson, you recall my remark, not ten minutes past,

00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,819
that Baker Street would not remain quiet tonight?

00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,359
The game, it seems, has begun.

00:07:15,979 --> 00:07:17,459
A vanishing piano, Watson.

00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:19,919
Have you ever heard of such a marvel?

00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,439
Never, Holmes.

00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:25,079
And I confess, I still struggle to believe it possible.

00:07:25,939 --> 00:07:30,919
That is because you rely upon probability rather than possibility.

00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,099
The improbable, my dear friend, happens daily.

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,060
It is only the impossible that remains forever barred.

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,060
Let us then ascertain whether Mr. Sin, whether Mr.

00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:49,199
Penfield's pianoforte is improbable or impossible.

00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,079
Mr. Penfield, you must take us to your lodgings at once.

00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:59,560
With all my heart, sir, I have prayed for nothing, so much as your assistance.

00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,319
But I warn you, the landlady is hostile.

00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:06,160
She believes me deranged and would prefer the matter hushed up.

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:15,900
So much the better. Opposition sharpens the wits. Watson, your hat and coat. We go to Bloomsbury.

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
Penfield clutched his photo upon his lap as though it were life itself.

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,159
I, for my part, could not dispel the image of a piano vanishing before the eyes of its player.

00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,159
The city seemed to close in around us, whispering of secrets hidden in shadow,

00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,159
as we drove towards the first act of a most singular mystery.

00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,159
The descent into the lower rooms of Mrs. Gaskill's boarding house was accomplished

00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,159
with much creaking of timbers and muttered protests from the landlady,

00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,159
who had reappeared upon hearing our footsteps.

00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,199
The candlelight trembled against wallpaper, already blistered with damp,

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:12,620
and the air drew close with the odor of boiled cabbage and cold smoke.

00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,000
Hmm, Mr. Hmm.

00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,399
Hemphine followed like a man condemned, clutching his folio tightly against his dress,

00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,259
while Holmes moved ahead with swift, noiseless tread,

00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:24,360
pausing at every landing to examine the walls, the banisters,

00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:26,839
the very nails that held the carpet runner in place.

00:09:27,459 --> 00:09:30,339
Watson, observe the spacing of these boards.

00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,819
They are old oak, but recently disturbed.

00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,480
Note the faint discolouration along the edges.

00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,260
Something has been lifted here and replaced within the last month.

00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:45,200
Yes, Holmes, I see the difference in you,

00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:47,640
though I should have walked past without remarking it.

00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,420
Precisely.

00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,080
The criminal counts upon the public's blindness to detail.

00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,820
To the trained eye, however, each grain of wood is a witness.

00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,200
Now let us inquire of Mrs. Gaskell.

00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,160
If you're meaning the floor, sir,

00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:05,100
it was repaired a fortnight ago.

00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:09,480
My second-floor lodger complained of drafts.

00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:12,839
A carpenter from Holborn came to lay new planks.

00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,799
Hey, just so.

00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:18,480
And what was the name of this carpenter?

00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,219
I couldn't tell you.

00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:22,339
Some tall fellow with a red beard.

00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,779
I paid him in coin and thought no more about it.

00:10:26,719 --> 00:10:27,240
A pity.

00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:31,519
Yet red beards like pianos cannot vanish without trace.

00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,600
Watson, make a note of it

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,740
Now, let us see what lies immediately beneath Mr. Penfew's chamber

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,500
We entered the second floor room, which was at present unoccupied

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,340
Its bed stripped bare, its furniture cloaked in dust sheets

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,439
Holmes paced to the centre of the floor and tapped with his cane

00:10:49,439 --> 00:10:53,100
producing a hollow resonance unlike the solid tone one would expect

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,539
He dropped to one knee, pressed his ear against the boards

00:10:55,539 --> 00:10:57,500
and then smiled in quiet satisfaction

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
There, Watson, do you not hear it?

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,600
A cavity beneath, large enough, I dare say, to swallow more than draughts, large enough,

00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,019
perhaps, for an entire piano forte.

00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:13,460
A hidden chamber, then the piano may not have left the house at all.

00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:14,860
Exactly.

00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,440
Now, the question remains, by what mechanism was it lowered from above without Mr. Penfield

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:23,820
perceiving the transition?

00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,860
Lowered, sir?

00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:27,279
You astonish me.

00:11:27,679 --> 00:11:29,679
Surely I would have fez the descent beneath me.

00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,779
Would you?

00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,600
Consider, the player is absorbed in his art,

00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,399
his mind fixed upon the score, his hands occupied upon the keys.

00:11:44,019 --> 00:11:47,879
If the entire floor beneath the instrument descended slowly,

00:11:47,879 --> 00:11:51,159
by counterweight, perhaps, or hydraulic piston,

00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,879
you might experience only a curious vibration,

00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:58,139
such as you described, a hum beneath the floorboards.

00:11:58,139 --> 00:11:58,899
Oh!

00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:02,379
Thumbs' words struck me

00:12:02,379 --> 00:12:03,819
with the force of revelation.

00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,720
The notion of an entire piano

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,860
being swallowed by the earth seemed wild

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,039
and yet the hollow echo of the boards

00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:12,059
lent it credence.

00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:13,919
My friend's eyes shone with excitement

00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,840
like a scientist on the brink of discovery.

00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:19,319
Watson, fetch that poker from the fireplace.

00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:21,899
We shall test these boards for weakness.

00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,200
I complied

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,580
and together we prized up a length of flooring.

00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:27,980
Beneath lay darkness

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,820
But as Holmes lowered the candle into the aperture, the flickering light revealed an astonishing sight.

00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:37,659
A shaft descending into the depths of the house, lined with wooden beams and fitted with ropes and pulleys.

00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:44,120
At the bottom, far below, we glimpsed the curved outline of what could only be a piano, resting silently in the gloom.

00:12:44,899 --> 00:12:47,159
Good heavens, there it is, the instrument itself.

00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:50,180
Merciful Providence, my piano.

00:12:51,159 --> 00:12:53,680
So much for vanishing into thin air.

00:12:53,679 --> 00:13:00,659
The trick, Watson, is as old as a stage, a trap door, ingeniously concealed,

00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,479
through which the entire pianoforte has been lowered.

00:13:06,179 --> 00:13:07,459
The hum.

00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:12,000
Penfield heard was the sound of machinery.

00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:14,699
The question is, why?

00:13:17,699 --> 00:13:20,879
With Holmes's guidance, we descended to the ground floor,

00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,759
where a locked door barred our way to the cellars.

00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:29,100
Mrs. Gaskell, though reluctant, produced a key muttering of nonsense and foolishness.

00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:33,200
Within, we found a cavernous space, its walls lined with coal and firewood,

00:13:33,439 --> 00:13:37,340
but in the centre stood a wooden platform connected to ropes, wheels and counterweights.

00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,679
On that platform, like some sacrificial idol, rested the pianoforte, unscathed but eerily silent.

00:13:44,419 --> 00:13:46,059
There you have it, Watson.

00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:51,979
a perfectly contrived stage elevator concealed within a humble boarding house.

00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:58,399
Such craftsmanship bespeaks not a common carpenter, but a mechanic of considerable skill.

00:13:59,099 --> 00:14:02,559
See the polish of the wheels, the precision of the grooves.

00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,559
This is the work of a master.

00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:10,539
But to what end? Why lower a piano into the cellars beneath its owner's nose?

00:14:11,359 --> 00:14:14,299
That, my dear fellow, is the heart of the mystery.

00:14:14,299 --> 00:14:16,879
Peft is the obvious explanation

00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:19,919
Yet the instrument remains here untouched

00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,399
Sabotage?

00:14:22,259 --> 00:14:22,979
Perhaps

00:14:22,979 --> 00:14:25,539
Or perhaps something more elaborate

00:14:25,539 --> 00:14:28,419
Something that concerns not the piano itself

00:14:28,419 --> 00:14:30,299
But the music it bears

00:14:30,299 --> 00:14:32,339
You bewilder me, sir

00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:34,459
Who would wish to sabotage my work?

00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,419
I am no celebrity, only a struggling composer

00:14:37,419 --> 00:14:42,479
And yet, Mr. Penfield

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:47,860
Even a struggling composer may stumble upon a melody others desire to suppress.

00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,539
Tell me, your composition, does it borrow from any source,

00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:56,259
any folk song, any secret theme entrusted to you?

00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,519
None, sir. The music is wholly my own, though.

00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,539
Hmm. Though what? Hmm.

00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,600
There is one peculiarity. The central motif came to me in a dream.

00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,139
I awoke with it ringing in my ears,

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,460
as though some unseen musician had played it to me in the night.

00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,939
I wrote it down at once, and it has since become the very soul of my concerto.

00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:21,279
Holmes's brows knitted, and he muttered half to himself,

00:15:21,699 --> 00:15:25,939
A melody in a dream, a piano swallowed by machinery,

00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,039
a brass fragment that does not belong.

00:15:29,379 --> 00:15:33,019
Watson, we are upon the edge of something curious indeed.

00:15:33,539 --> 00:15:37,360
Mark me, this affair reaches deeper than Bloomsbury.

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,879
I must know who built this contrivance and for whose hand.

00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,320
Then you suspect a conspiracy?

00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,899
I suspect only that human ingenuity rarely expends itself without motive.

00:15:51,539 --> 00:15:56,300
Somewhere in London is a man with a red beard and a talent for hidden machinery.

00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:59,800
Find him, Watson, and we find our truth.

00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,060
Meanwhile, Mr. Penfield, I urge you to guard your score most carefully.

00:16:06,059 --> 00:16:12,599
For if your enemies cannot steal your piano, they may attempt to steal the song itself.

00:16:13,779 --> 00:16:19,299
At that moment, a distant bell tolled the hour, its mournfully clang echoing through the cellar like a warning.

00:16:19,539 --> 00:16:22,299
Holmes extinguished the candle and straightened to his full height.

00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,799
His face was grave, yet his eyes glittered with anticipation.

00:16:26,939 --> 00:16:29,819
Come, gentlemen, we have seen enough for tonight.

00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,239
Tomorrow we hunt the man with the red beard.

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,680
Thus ended the first stage of our adventure.

00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,320
A piano found, yet the riddle deepened,

00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,919
a mystery solved, yet a greater enigma born.

00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,940
I could not then imagine how perilous our quest would become,

00:16:46,299 --> 00:16:49,100
nor how the song itself would draw us into a web of intrigue

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,240
that reached far beyond the walls of Bloomsbury.

00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,299
When morning broke over Baker Street the following day,

00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,580
the fog had lifted, and Mazel, the air still hung heavy

00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,840
with the acrid smoke of a thousand chimneys.

00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,480
Holmes had risen before me, as was often his custom,

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,860
and when I emerged from my room, I found him already at the table with maps, directories

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,079
and his chemical apparatus scattered around him in chaotic order.

00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:12,660
He had exchanged his dressing gown for a tweed suit

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,319
and the energy in his movements told me that his mind had raced far into the mystery during the night.

00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:21,339
Holmes, you look as though you have already solved the case before breakfast.

00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,720
Not solved, Watson.

00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:26,799
Merely sharpened the tools with which to cut.

00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,180
We are in pursuit of a red-bearded mechanic,

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:37,400
a craftsman of no mean ability, who installed a trap capable of lowering an entire pianoforte

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,920
into the bowels of a Broomsbury boarding-house. Such a man cannot be common. London swarms with

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,519
tinkers and carpenters, but few who could accomplish such engineering in secrecy.

00:17:51,019 --> 00:17:56,440
Therefore he must be known in certain circles. And how do you propose to find him?

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,120
By the oldest method of all, my dear fellow, inquiry,

00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,799
I have already dispatched young Wiggins and his Baker Street irregulars

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,240
to gorm the workshops of Holborn and Clerkenwell.

00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,080
A red-beard Watson is a beacon.

00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,799
With luck, by noon we shall have a name.

00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,100
As if on cue, there came a tapping at the door,

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,580
and in shuffle Wiggins, the street urchin,

00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,600
whose quick eyes and nimble feet had served us in many an adventure,

00:18:25,599 --> 00:18:28,639
He removed his cap and spoke with his usual bluntness.

00:18:29,459 --> 00:18:30,719
Beg pardon, Mr. Holmes.

00:18:31,299 --> 00:18:31,919
We found dine.

00:18:32,259 --> 00:18:35,579
Name, oh Ezekiel Trenchard, keeps a whisk shop off Leather Lane.

00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,839
Folks call him Red Zeke on account of the whiskers.

00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,439
Bids are contraptions.

00:18:40,859 --> 00:18:44,199
Stage rigs, hidden doors, trap mechanisms for them, theaters.

00:18:44,719 --> 00:18:47,659
Got a reputation for being clever, but not over-scrupulous.

00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,359
Excellent, Wiggins.

00:18:49,859 --> 00:18:53,039
You and your lads have earned your shillings handsomely.

00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:57,379
Here, take this coin and keep watch upon Mr. Trenchard's premises.

00:18:58,119 --> 00:19:00,119
Report to me, any visitor of note.

00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:03,599
Listen, we go at once to Leather Lane.

00:19:04,379 --> 00:19:07,279
Soon we were rattling through the crowded streets in a cab,

00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,680
home silent and intent.

00:19:09,019 --> 00:19:10,940
I armed with my revolver by long habit,

00:19:11,259 --> 00:19:13,079
though half convinced it would not be needed.

00:19:13,379 --> 00:19:15,460
Leather Lane proved a narrow thoroughfare

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,139
cluttered with coast among us guards and shouting hawkers.

00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:20,319
At its far end we found the place,

00:19:20,319 --> 00:19:22,879
a grimy workshop with windows thick with soot,

00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:27,180
and above the door, a fading sign, E. Plenchard, Engineer of Mechanisms.

00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:33,700
Observe, Watson, the iron filings upon the sill, the heavy crates by the entrance.

00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:38,779
Business here is active, though the sign suggests disuse.

00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,000
Consumment in plain sight, as ever.

00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,899
We entered and were met with a curious sight.

00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:48,159
The interior resembled a magician's storeroom.

00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:52,240
Wheels, pulleys, counterweights, and elaborate frames crowded every surface.

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,279
At the far bench, bending over a set of blueprints, stood a broad-shouldered man with a mane of flaming beard.

00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,740
He straightened, eyes narrowing at our intrusion.

00:20:01,599 --> 00:20:05,480
Who are ye and what's your business in Ezekiel Trenchard's shop?

00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:11,140
Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and this is my colleague, Dr. Watson.

00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:19,900
We come regarding a certain Ganoforte, lowered into a cellar by means of a trap you constructed in a Bloomsbury house.

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,880
So, the trap worked, eh?

00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,000
Ha! I told him it would.

00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,560
Smooth as silk, down she goes.

00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,900
But what business is that of yours?

00:20:30,820 --> 00:20:33,180
The business of justice, Mr. Trenchard.

00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,600
You were hired by someone to create this contrivance.

00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,500
I must know who.

00:20:39,380 --> 00:20:40,680
Now, why should I tell you?

00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,019
My clients pay well for silence.

00:20:44,019 --> 00:20:47,580
Because your client intends more than theatrics.

00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:54,599
and you may find yourself accessory to a crime far darker than mere carpentry.

00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,799
Consider carefully, Mr. Trenchard.

00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:01,779
The law makes no distinction between the man who builds the pistol

00:21:01,779 --> 00:21:04,480
and the man who pulls the trigger.

00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:11,139
The mechanic's ruddy face paled somewhat, though his eyes still glittered with defiance.

00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,059
I was paid in sovereigns to build a stage lift, not to ask questions.

00:21:16,059 --> 00:21:17,819
But, well, I'll tell you this much.

00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:20,319
The man who hired me called himself Mr. Green.

00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:23,919
Thin fellow. Foreign accent. Eyes sharp as knives.

00:21:24,259 --> 00:21:26,720
He brought sketches. Knew what he wanted.

00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:29,679
Paid half in advance, half on completion.

00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,099
That's all I know.

00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,659
A foreign accent, you say?

00:21:34,019 --> 00:21:36,119
Could you identify his nationality?

00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,859
German, maybe. Or Austrian.

00:21:39,359 --> 00:21:41,259
Something from the continent, that's sure.

00:21:42,019 --> 00:21:44,220
Indeed. And this Mr. Green?

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,220
did he mention why he required the piano to vanish?

00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,339
Not in so many words.

00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:51,180
Only said the music was dangerous,

00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:53,759
that it must be silenced before it was heard.

00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,779
I thought him cracked, but his money was sound.

00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,279
Dangerous music.

00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,019
Holmes exchanged a glance with me,

00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:03,000
his brows lifting in silent emphasis.

00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,680
Dangerous music!

00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,279
The phrase struck a chord of unease within me.

00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:11,440
Holmes, surely he does not mean that Mr. Penfield's composition holds some secret?

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:23,299
It seems increasingly probable, Watson. Music may convey more than melody. Codes, signals, even mathematical formulae can be embedded within notes.

00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,960
Mr. Trenchard! Did Mr. Trenchard!

00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,460
Green, give any instruction beyond the trap's construction?

00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:39,980
Only this, that once the piano was lowered, it must remain below until he returned with men to fetch it away.

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,240
I asked when that might be, but he only laughed and said,

00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,240
when the last note is played.

00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,380
A curious phrase indeed.

00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:49,799
Very well, Mr. Gaines.

00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,839
Trenchard, you have been frank, and I shall not press you further.

00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:56,259
But take warning.

00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,559
If harm comes of this scheme, your name will not be spared.

00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:01,720
Good day.

00:23:02,599 --> 00:23:05,599
With that, Owens turned upon his heel and strode into the street,

00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:07,839
leaving the mechanic to mutter among his gears.

00:23:07,839 --> 00:23:09,779
I hurried after him, bewildered.

00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:14,819
Holmes, what can it mean? Dangerous musics? Surely a tune is but a tune.

00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:18,559
Do not underestimate the subtle arts, Watson.

00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:24,880
Consider the ancients who believed music could stir armies or calm tempests.

00:23:25,539 --> 00:23:29,579
Consider the mathematician who may encode a cipher within notes.

00:23:30,079 --> 00:23:34,559
Suppose, mister, Penfield's melody, born in a dream, he says,

00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:38,079
contains a secret intended never to be revealed.

00:23:38,079 --> 00:23:42,799
But revealed by whom?

00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:47,019
That, my dear fellow, is what we must discover.

00:23:47,659 --> 00:23:49,919
Come, we return to Bigger Street.

00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:52,419
There is research to be done.

00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:56,839
Back at our lodgings, Holmes immersed himself in his volumes of arcane knowledge.

00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:00,720
He rifled through treatises on cryptography, histories of secret societies,

00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,480
and even monographs upon the psychology of music.

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,139
All afternoon he pored over staves and scales,

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:09,820
humming fragments of Penfield's score that the composer had left with us.

00:24:10,259 --> 00:24:13,380
At last, as twilight fell, he sprang up with a cry of triumph.

00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:17,060
Watson, it is as I suspected.

00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,200
The motif concedes a code.

00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:20,060
Look here.

00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,300
Take the first note of each bar.

00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:25,480
Convert its pitch to a letter by simple substitution.

00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,100
And what do you read?

00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:32,100
I bent over the paper, and slowly the letters resolved themselves into words.

00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,420
My heart gave a leap.

00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:35,360
Oh, the key lies in Vienna.

00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,359
Good heavens, Holmes, it is a message.

00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:42,339
Precisely. And not merely a message, but a directive.

00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:48,339
Someone has planted within Penfield's dream a melody

00:24:48,339 --> 00:24:52,899
which conceals the command to seek a key in Vienna.

00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,559
The question is, who and why?

00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,500
At that instant, a knock rattled the door.

00:24:58,879 --> 00:25:00,659
Mrs. Hudson entered, pale and trembling.

00:25:01,759 --> 00:25:04,819
Mr. Holmes, there's a gentleman below asking for you.

00:25:04,819 --> 00:25:10,639
says his name is Green. Will you see him? Holmes's eyes flashed. He reached for his violin,

00:25:11,019 --> 00:25:15,059
set it upon the table as though it were a weapon and whispered to me in urgent tones.

00:25:15,939 --> 00:25:20,559
The game quickens, Watson. Mr. Green has come to us of his own accord.

00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,159
Ready yourself. We may at last confront the mind behind the vanishing piano.

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:32,240
The fire burned low in our Baker Street sitting room, casting long flickering shadows against

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,599
the bookshelves and the framed Persian slipper on the mantle. Mrs. Hudson had scarcely finished

00:25:38,599 --> 00:25:42,900
announcing the visitor when the man himself entered, and I confess my blood chilled at the

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,640
sight. He was tall, gaunt, with the pallor of one who lived more in lamplight than under the sun.

00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,960
He was trim-close, his hair slick-bat with continental precision, but it was his eyes

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,039
that arrested me, icy-gray, piercing, restless, darting from Holmes to myself and back again

00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,759
with the vigilance of a predator.

00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,220
Herr Holmes, said he in a voice soft yet cutting,

00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:05,940
and Dr. Watson, ja?

00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:09,379
So the hounds have scented me sooner than I expected.

00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,279
Mr. Green, or should I say Herr Grun,

00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,539
Austrian, perhaps Prussian,

00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,319
certainly of the German tongue,

00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,839
you honour us by stepping into our den voluntarily.

00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,940
May I offer you a chair?

00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:26,599
Your courtesy is wasted, sir.

00:26:27,139 --> 00:26:28,220
I came not for tea,

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,039
but to reclaim what is mine, the piano, and the melody that resided in it.

00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,240
You have interfered sufficiently.

00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,299
Yours? The piano belongs to Mr. Mr.

00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:42,600
Dild, Enfield, a humble composer who never sought entanglement with espionage.

00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
Tote dows it to being biny, this.

00:26:45,539 --> 00:26:48,380
Ah, poor Penfield, a vessel only, not the source.

00:26:48,759 --> 00:26:52,019
He dreamed the melody because it was planted in him.

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,100
A modic suggestion, gentlemen.

00:26:55,099 --> 00:26:59,299
We of the continent have studied such arts deeply.

00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:04,339
In a moment between waking and sleep, we gave him the theme, never knowing if it would blossom.

00:27:04,819 --> 00:27:07,359
It did, and it contained more than music.

00:27:08,379 --> 00:27:12,919
A cipher encoding the phrase, the key lies in Vienna.

00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,959
We have already deciphered it, Herr Grun.

00:27:16,599 --> 00:27:19,359
But tell me, what key and why Vienna?

00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,099
You are clever, Holmes, but not omniscient.

00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:27,559
omniscient. The melody concealed the location of a document, an agreement signed secretly between

00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:32,939
two empires that could plunge Europe into chaos if revealed. The piano was to vanish until we

00:27:32,939 --> 00:27:39,579
might transport it safely abroad. But you, you have meddled. His voice rose and for a moment

00:27:39,579 --> 00:27:44,259
the mask of control slipped, revealing the fanatic beneath. Holmes, however, remained

00:27:44,259 --> 00:27:48,500
unruffled, tapping his long fingers together as though playing an invisible clavier.

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,940
Your plan was ingenious, I grant you

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,779
To hide a cipher within a tune

00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:57,619
Entrusted to a dreamer who believed it

00:27:57,619 --> 00:28:00,220
His own composition, admirable

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,119
But you erred in one respect

00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,359
And that is?

00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:08,519
In thinking that London

00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,119
The city with eyes and ears in every alley

00:28:12,119 --> 00:28:16,680
Would allow a foreign agent to burrow unseen

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,600
Your red-bearded accomplice betrayed you by his very uniqueness

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,180
and your arrogance brought you to my doorstep.

00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,960
Groom's hand twitched toward his coat pocket,

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,660
but quicker than thought Holmes had drawn the revolver he seldom carried,

00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,400
save at direst need.

00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:36,100
How do not, Herr Groom?

00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:38,799
My friend Watson also carries an arm,

00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:45,039
and unlike myself he has spent service years firing it in earnest.

00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:49,420
Track and indeed sir, I said firmly, though my heart pounded.

00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:50,960
Smiling thinly.

00:28:51,639 --> 00:28:54,019
So, you have me tracked, but what will you do, Holmes?

00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,079
Turn me to Skarnanyard?

00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,180
They will not grasp the significance of what I bear.

00:28:58,599 --> 00:29:00,359
The melody is still in my mind.

00:29:00,819 --> 00:29:05,220
The key remains hidden in Vienna, awaiting only the one who can read the notes.

00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:11,379
Your mind perhaps, but music may be copied, analysed, destroyed.

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,380
The tomb lies also with me now, and I have no intention of allowing it into careless hands.

00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:27,380
As for you, Lestrade shall know what to do with an agent of espionage who traffics in stolen secrets.

00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:35,380
At that moment, heavy boots slattered upon the stairs, and Inspector Lestrade himself burst into the room, breathless but resolute.

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Horns, it seemed, had sent a telegram earlier in the day.

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,660
Holmes, Watson, I came as quick as I could, and this, I take it, is our quarry.

00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:52,060
Indeed, Lestrade. Herr Grün, alias Mr. Green, foreign agent, mastermind of the vanishing piano.

00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,400
Hmm, he is yours. Hmm.

00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,620
Bitterly, so the curtain falls. But mark me, Holmes, the play is not ended.

00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:04,440
Vienna will yet sing, and when she does, Europe shall tremble.

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,640
With iron restraint, Lestrade's men clapped irons upon the spy and bore him,

00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,680
struggling down the stairs.

00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:15,100
The echoes of his threats lingered in the room long after his footsteps had faded.

00:30:15,759 --> 00:30:17,980
The days that followed were filled with inquiry.

00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:22,539
The Foreign Office, apprised of the matter, hushed the affair with typical discretion,

00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,740
whispering only of continental intrigues and tanking Holmes in guarded phrases.

00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,299
Mr. Herm, Penfield the composer, was released from suspicion,

00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:36,200
though he vowed never again to trust a melody that arrived unbidden in his dreams.

00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:40,079
Horns, I said one evening, as we sat once more by our fire.

00:30:40,339 --> 00:30:42,799
I cannot shake the unease that blings to this case.

00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,460
A melody planted like a parasite in the mind,

00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,220
a piano swallowed by the earth,

00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,460
and a spy who claims that the fate of Europe rests upon a tune.

00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:52,220
It all seems scarcely credible.

00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:54,879
Yet credible it is, Watson.

00:30:55,339 --> 00:30:58,339
Men will go to astounding lengths for power.

00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:01,220
Today it is ink upon a treaty.

00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:05,099
Tomorrow, it may be a code hidden in music.

00:31:05,579 --> 00:31:08,019
The human mind is both lock and key,

00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,419
and there will always be those who seek to master it.

00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:13,220
But what of the message?

00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,599
The key lies in Vienna.

00:31:14,879 --> 00:31:17,539
Have we truly forestalled danger or only delayed it?

00:31:18,119 --> 00:31:20,839
We have struck a blow, not finished the war.

00:31:21,559 --> 00:31:24,119
Another agent may pursue the secret in Vienna,

00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,519
but Herr Grün's immediate scheme is ended.

00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:31,700
Our duty lies not in reshaping empires,

00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:36,180
but in defending the innocent who stumble, like Penfield,

00:31:36,539 --> 00:31:38,660
into the path of darker designs.

00:31:39,839 --> 00:31:41,619
I could not argue with this philosophy,

00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,519
though it left me with a gnawing sense

00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,579
that larger forces moved beyond the grasp of any detective.

00:31:46,859 --> 00:31:49,160
However brilliant, Holmes leaned back,

00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,940
his keen profile illuminated by the lamplight,

00:31:52,259 --> 00:31:53,839
and drew his violin from its case.

00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:00,259
Listen, Watson, here is the theme as Penfield dreamed it.

00:32:00,959 --> 00:32:04,439
He played the haunting string, notes rising like ghosts in the air.

00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:09,859
To my ears it was both beautiful and sorrowful, a whisper from some realm beyond reason.

00:32:09,859 --> 00:32:13,500
Yet as Holmes played, I fancied I heard beneath the melody another voice,

00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:16,259
the echo of groom's warning that Vienna would yet sing.

00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:19,439
When the final note faded, Holmes lowered the bow,

00:32:19,699 --> 00:32:23,059
though his eyes, half-closed, betrayed a fatigue deeper than physical.

00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:35,359
it is finished watson for now remember always every tune has its last note the trick is to know when it has truly ended

00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:38,639
And so, continued the affair of the song of the vanishing piano.

00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:43,959
A case unlike any other, where espionage, music and human imagination intertwined.

00:32:44,179 --> 00:32:47,919
To this day, whenever I hear the lonely strains of a violin in the night,

00:32:48,139 --> 00:32:51,039
I recall the vision of that piano sinking into the earth.

00:32:51,359 --> 00:32:54,899
The cry of a spy undone and the figure of Sherlock Holmes declaring,

00:32:55,259 --> 00:32:58,679
with his customary calm, that for him, everything was elementary.
