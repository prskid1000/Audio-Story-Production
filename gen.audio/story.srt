00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,900
It was in the late autumn of 1888 that one of the most singular cases in the long annals of my ASOC,

00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,830
Ayeshan with Sherlock Holmes, first presented itself.

00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:13,640
The days had grown short, and the fog of London lay upon the city like a barrier shroud.

00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:17,570
Chasom at the ward, I recall clearly the dim yellow of the gas lamps,

00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:19,400
struggling feebly through the haze,

00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:22,950
the constant clatter of handsome gabs upon wet cobblestones,

00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,370
and the peculiar air of dread which hung upon us all,

00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:28,240
though none could say precisely why.

00:00:28,239 --> 00:00:31,439
At Baker Street, however, the mood was different.

00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,149
Our sitting room was warmed by a bright coal fire,

00:00:34,149 --> 00:00:36,709
the familiar scent of pipe smoke thick in the air,

00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:38,939
and my companion lay sprawled upon the settee,

00:00:38,939 --> 00:00:40,869
his long thin frame stretched at ease,

00:00:40,869 --> 00:00:43,289
while his keen grey eyes remained anything but idle.

00:00:43,289 --> 00:00:45,959
He was studying a slip of paper with such intensity

00:00:45,959 --> 00:00:49,240
that I wondered if it might combust beneath his gaze.

00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:52,990
You have been upon that same strap for nearly an hour, Holmes.

00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:56,480
Ope! What intelligence does it contain that should so rivet you?

00:00:56,479 --> 00:01:00,959
merely a request for aid, my dear Watson,

00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:03,939
a request clothed in vagueness,

00:01:03,939 --> 00:01:06,889
which makes it all the more interesting.

00:01:06,889 --> 00:01:09,519
The letter purports to come from a certain

00:01:09,519 --> 00:01:11,710
Colonel Sir Reginald Stanhope,

00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,060
recently returned from colonial service in India.

00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,920
He writes of a family seat in Devonshire

00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,859
and of a curse said to dwell upon the waterfall

00:01:20,859 --> 00:01:22,159
near his estate.

00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,219
..

00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:23,979
A curse, Holmes?

00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:26,579
Surely you cannot lend credence to such superstition.

00:01:26,579 --> 00:01:28,040
..

00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,219
Superstition is but the refuge of those who have not yet perceived the chain of cause and effect.

00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:38,700
I do not for an instant accept the existence of curses.

00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,719
Yet I observe with interest the effect of such beliefs upon the human mind

00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:47,200
and the human conduct that springs therefrom.

00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:50,620
Remember, Watson, it is not the legend that kills.

00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:54,880
It is the man who acts under the influence of the legend.

00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:20,620
..........................

00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:26,800
danger aplenty. And what action do you propose we take? Why, we go to Devonshire, of course.

00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:34,189
The Colonel requests our presence with urgency. His letter bears signs of haste. The ink blot here,

00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:41,240
the irregular strokes there. He is a man of disciplined habits, no doubt. Yet this letter

00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:46,939
reveals agitation. Something has already occurred, which has shaken him from composure.

00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:50,340
You read all that from a blot of ink?

00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,810
From the blot, and from the tremor in the line,

00:02:53,810 --> 00:02:56,919
and from the very choice of words, my dear fellow.

00:02:56,919 --> 00:02:58,840
It is all elementary.

00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,979
..

00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,550
Warning, thus it was settled.

00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,709
By the following morning we had packed our cases,

00:03:03,709 --> 00:03:06,750
and with little delay were on the train bound for the west.

00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,909
The journey was long and dreary,

00:03:08,909 --> 00:03:11,139
the rain streaking upon the carriage windows,

00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:13,639
while I occupied myself with my medical notes

00:03:13,639 --> 00:03:15,520
and Holmes with his pipe and silence.

00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:20,400
Yet I could not shake from my mind the phrase which he had read aloud from the colonel's letter.

00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,660
The curse of the waterfall has claimed another.

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:23,780
..

00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,520
At Exeter Station we were met by the colonel himself,

00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:32,480
a tall, spare man of military bearing, with silvered hair and a face deeply aligned by both sun and worry.

00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:38,580
His handshake was firm, yet his eyes betrayed an unrest that no discipline could entirely conceal.

00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:44,140
Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, I cannot tell you what a relief it is to see you.

00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:46,759
You come at a most desperate hour.

00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,079
..

00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,639
We lose no time, Colonel.

00:03:49,639 --> 00:03:53,799
Tell us, has another death indeed occurred, as your letter implied?

00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:55,259
..

00:03:55,259 --> 00:03:57,879
Aye, my own steward, Samuel Price.

00:03:57,879 --> 00:03:59,189
Samuel Price.

00:03:59,189 --> 00:04:05,259
Two nights ago, he was found lifeless at the foot of the great waterfall that lies within our estate.

00:04:05,259 --> 00:04:12,519
And what chins my blood, sir, is that he is the third three men in as many months, each claimed in the self-same fashion.

00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:15,009
You suggest they fell?

00:04:15,009 --> 00:04:17,160
Some say fell, some say jumped

00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,699
And the villagers whisper that they were drawn

00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,759
Dread by a force unseen

00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,480
They call it the curse of the Stanhope waterfall

00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,439
I cannot abide such talk

00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:28,480
But I cannot deny the deaths either

00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,540
You are wise to reject superstition, Colonel

00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,400
Yet you are also wise to summon me

00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,060
We shall look upon this waterfall

00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,709
and upon the bodies if possible,

00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:45,680
for the dead, no less than the living,

00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,450
may yield up their secrets to an inquiring eye.

00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:51,690
The colonel nodded gravely,

00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,649
and soon we were seated within his carriage,

00:04:53,649 --> 00:04:56,480
the horses drawing us through the winding Devonshire lanes.

00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,090
The landscape grew wilder as we advanced,

00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,920
great tors of granite rising against the darkening sky

00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,769
and a moor that stretched desolate and silent save for the wind.

00:05:05,769 --> 00:05:07,959
At last we came in sight of Stanhope Hall,

00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:11,799
a vast grey edifice standing grim against the encroaching night,

00:05:11,799 --> 00:05:16,089
and beyond it, through the mist, I glimpsed the white roar of tumbling water.

00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,679
That night, after a hurried supper in the echoing dining hall,

00:05:19,679 --> 00:05:21,379
we were conducted to our chambers.

00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:25,379
I confess that fatigue weighed heavily upon me, but not so upon Holmes.

00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:29,319
Long after the household had retired, I found him at the window of our shared room,

00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:33,289
his silhouette stark against the moonlight, gazing out toward the waterfall.

00:05:33,289 --> 00:05:36,339
Holmes, where you never sleep, the hour grows late.

00:05:36,339 --> 00:05:42,579
Sleep, Watson, is for those who have not a mystery roaring in their ears.

00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:46,759
Do you not hear it, the voice of that waterfall,

00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,159
nature herself thundering like an orator,

00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:55,349
proclaiming some dreadful truth which man has not yet deciphered?

00:05:55,349 --> 00:05:58,189
To me it is but water tumbling over rocks.

00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:02,039
And therein lies the difference between us, my dear fellow.

00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,459
To you the sound is but sound.

00:06:05,459 --> 00:06:09,079
To me, it is the overture to a drama.

00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:14,329
Come the morrow, we shall attend the stage and watch the play unfold.

00:06:14,329 --> 00:06:18,959
With that, he turned from the window, his keen eyes alight with anticipation,

00:06:18,959 --> 00:06:21,829
and I knew that whatever dark force haunted this place,

00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:24,879
Sherlock Holmes had already cast his lot against it.

00:06:24,879 --> 00:06:27,740
The following day, dawned with a sky of iron,

00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,279
Colonel Stanhope led us to the falls, a mile's walk across sodden fields,

00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:35,339
and into a narrow gorge where the land seemed to close about us like a pair of jaws.

00:06:35,339 --> 00:06:50,699
there through the mist and spray the waterfall revealed itself in its awful grandeur thundering down from a height of sixty feet into a cauldron of foam below the very ground trembled with its power by heavens holmes to stumble upon these rocks would be certain death

00:06:50,699 --> 00:07:02,839
just so watson and yet note the path though perilous it is still a path one does not tumble here by chance but rather by design or compulsion

00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:15,000
horns crouched upon the whetstones his gaze flitting from mark to mark with an intensity that left me bewildered he plucked up a broken branch sniffed it cast it aside then examined a scuff upon the rock face with his lens

00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:32,500
observe watson the print of a boot the heel is square the tread heavy a labourer's boot consistent with that of a steward yet see here another mark overlaying it a finer sole narrow likely that of a lady

00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:37,089
And here, the drag of a cane or walking stick.

00:07:37,089 --> 00:07:39,040
Curious, most curious.

00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:41,480
...

00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,120
You astonish me, Holmes.

00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,460
Are you suggesting that another was with him?

00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,129
I suggest nothing.

00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:48,620
I merely observe.

00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:52,300
But the conclusion, when it comes, will brook no doubt.

00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,549
At that instant, a sharp cry rang out from behind us.

00:07:55,549 --> 00:07:58,060
A return to behold a young woman, pale and trembling,

00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,399
who had approached unobserved.

00:07:59,399 --> 00:08:02,220
She was clad in a simple gown, her hair disordered,

00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,780
her eyes wide with fear.

00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,840
..

00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,540
You must not go nearer.

00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,650
The falls are cursed.

00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:10,080
Do not tempt fate as the others did.

00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,540
.....

00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,389
Mary, what are you doing here?

00:08:16,389 --> 00:08:18,240
Return to the hall at once.

00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,300
I cannot, father.

00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:23,240
I cannot rest while the curse remains.

00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,880
Each night I dream of it

00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,970
and each day I feel its pull.

00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,920
Mr. Holmes, you must save us.

00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:30,139
You must.

00:08:30,139 --> 00:08:32,580
Holmes bowed with grave courtesy,

00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:35,650
yet his eyes shone with that peculiar game I had come to recognize,

00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:38,440
the game of discovery hovering just beyond his reach.

00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,480
..

00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:44,120
Miss Stanhope, I assure you I shall leave no stone unturned.

00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:47,080
But I must beg you to tell me all you know.

00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,259
The safety of others may depend upon it.

00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,110
And so, by the thundering roar of the cursed waterfall,

00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:55,890
the tale began to unravel.

00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,740
The strange apparition of young Miss Mary Stanhope,

00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,440
trembling by the torrent, haunted my thoughts throughout that day. We returned with her and

00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,809
the Colonel to the hall, the mist closing behind us like the curtain of some grim theatre. Holmes,

00:09:07,809 --> 00:09:13,139
however, appeared invigorated rather than troubled. I recognised that eager light in his eye,

00:09:13,139 --> 00:09:18,150
which always betokened that he scented a pew. Holmes, what do you make of the girl's terror?

00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,299
Is she merely afflicted with the common superstition of these parts, or do you suspect

00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:28,000
she knows more than she dares reveal? A very pertinent question, Watson. Observe her manner.

00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,440
agitation genuine, yet her words chosen with curious restraint.

00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:38,769
She fears the waterfall, but also fears something more immediate.

00:09:38,769 --> 00:09:44,649
Did you note how her glance shifted toward her father before she spoke?

00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:49,029
Indeed I did, yet surely you would not suggest that the Colonel himself?

00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,500
I suggest nothing as yet, but I record every gesture, every hesitation.

00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,360
one never knows which trifle may illuminate the whole.

00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:03,279
That evening, after supper, Holmes and I took a stroll through the village

00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:05,170
which lay a short distance from the hall.

00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,340
The air was heavy with smoke from peat fires

00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,340
and the narrow lanes echoed with the gossip of rustic folk

00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:13,089
who regarded us with a mixture of suspicion and hope.

00:10:13,089 --> 00:10:16,819
The tale of the waterfall had evidently cast a pall over the community.

00:10:16,819 --> 00:10:20,519
The people stared at us as though we carried the cure to their plague.

00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:27,990
So we may, in a sense. Fear spreads like contagion, and nothing will allay it but reason.

00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:34,629
Come, let us enter this inn. I perceive from the sign that it is the king's arms,

00:10:34,629 --> 00:10:38,759
and such a place is the crucible of village rumour.

00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:44,360
Within, we found a low ceiling chamber, warm with firelight and loud with the murmur of voices.

00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,860
The landlord, a stout man with ruddy cheeks, eyed us with curiosity as we ordered ale and

00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,490
seated ourselves at a corner table. It was not long before a knot of villagers approached,

00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:58,620
emboldened perhaps by the drink or by our London attire.

00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:02,620
Beg pardon, sirs, but you're from the hall, ain't you? Strangers come for the curse, we reckoned.

00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:08,779
We come at the invitation of Colonel Stanhope to inquire into the deaths at the waterfall.

00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:09,879
..

00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:13,579
You call it a curse. Pray, tell me why.

00:11:13,579 --> 00:11:17,940
Could have been that way since old Sir William's days, sir. Long ago, before the Colonel's time,

00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:22,050
Sir William wronged a gypsy woman, drove her from the land with cruel words.

00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:26,120
She set her spell upon the fall, swore that any man who drew water there would find death.

00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:30,200
First it was cattle, then shepherds, and now, God help us, it's back again.

00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:33,180
Surely you cannot credit such a tale in this century?

00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:38,200
Begging your pardon, doctor, but we've seen too many bodies fetched from the pool below.

00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,430
My own brother swore he heard voices in the spray calling him by name.

00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:44,920
He scarce slept after, till he was found gone.

00:11:44,919 --> 00:11:53,620
Voices, you say? Most interesting. And tell me, have these deaths occurred at any particular hour?

00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,159
..

00:11:55,159 --> 00:12:00,589
Always at night, sir. Darker the moon, mostly. Folks say the falls glow then like silver fire.

00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:04,509
Holmes's eyes glittered, though he masked it quickly by sipping his ale.

00:12:04,509 --> 00:12:14,579
Gentlemen, madam, I thank you for your candour. Rest assured, I mean to examine every feature of this so-called curse.

00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:22,339
And I give you my solemn word. If it is the work of mortal hands, those hands shall be uncovered.

00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,299
..

00:12:24,299 --> 00:12:28,019
A murmur of approval and relief ran through the company, though some crossed themselves

00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:33,879
fortively, as though to ward against, meddling with forces unseen. Holmes, however, rose abruptly

00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:38,819
and beckoned me to follow. Big gut, you depart so soon? We might have learned more,

00:12:38,820 --> 00:12:46,120
tasis te hern. We have learned precisely enough. The legend of the gypsy, the voices in the spray,

00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:52,940
the glow of the water, all fragments of a mosaic which begins to take form. Come, Watson,

00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:58,620
the night is fine for observation. We quitted the inn and made our way back along the dark

00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:03,620
lanes to the gorge. The roar of the waterfall greeted us like the growl of some monstrous beast.

00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:08,760
The moon had risen, casting a pale glow upon the spray, which indeed shimmered with a spectral

00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:14,740
light. By Jove, Holmes, it does glow see how the mist catches the moonlight, as though it were

00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:21,579
silver flames. A beautiful optical effect, no doubt aided by certain minerals in the rock.

00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:28,889
Yet beauty often conceals danger. Look there, do you see, upon the far side, a faint glimmer,

00:13:28,889 --> 00:13:34,200
as of a lantern quickly extinguished? I see nothing, wait, yes, a flicker only.

00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,880
Someone lurks yonder.

00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,060
Indeed, we are not the only night watchers here.

00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,820
Remain silent, Watson, and crouch low.

00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,840
..

00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,220
We hid behind a boulder, scarcely daring to breathe.

00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:50,130
Minutes passed, and then we perceived a figure moving upon the opposite bank.

00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:52,990
It paused, lifted something that caught the moonlight,

00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,290
a rod perhaps, or a length of metal,

00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,720
and seemed to place it into the torrent itself.

00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,750
Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, the figure melted into the darkness.

00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,379
What devilry is this?

00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,909
Holmes, did you see?

00:14:04,909 --> 00:14:08,230
I saw enough to confirm my suspicion.

00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:13,089
Come, Watson, we must examine that spot at first light.

00:14:13,089 --> 00:14:18,139
For now, it would be folly to attempt the crossing in darkness.

00:14:18,139 --> 00:14:19,279
..

00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:23,580
I hardly slept that night, my mind restless with images of spectral lights

00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,829
and shadowy figures by the roaring falls.

00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:29,899
But Holmes seemed content, stretched upon his bed with the faintest of smiles,

00:14:29,899 --> 00:14:32,639
as though he had glimpsed already the outline of truth.

00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:39,049
At dawn we returned to the gorge, and with the colonel's permission descended to the place where the mysterious figure had stood.

00:14:39,049 --> 00:14:42,509
Their homes bent with his lens and gave a cry of satisfaction.

00:14:42,509 --> 00:14:52,120
See here, Watson, home, the imprint of boots, not the rough soles of a peasant, but well-made leather, narrow at the toe.

00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:59,279
Read, and here scraps of wire, recently cut. The fellow was at work, not in worship.

00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,740
At work upon what?

00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:16,170
That is the question. But note how these wires lead into the torrent itself. They vanish beneath the spray. Someone has contrived a mechanism in connection with the falls, Watson, and I mean to discover its purpose.

00:15:16,170 --> 00:15:22,129
Even as he spoke, a voice hailed us from the ridge above. It was Miss Mary, paying with alarm.

00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:28,019
Mr. Holmes, father begs your presence at once. There has been another, another death.

00:15:28,019 --> 00:15:31,829
Another? Good heavens! Who now?

00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:34,860
Mr. James Trevor, the curate's son.

00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,059
He was found at dawn dashed upon the rocks, just as the others.

00:15:39,059 --> 00:15:41,519
Holmes's jaw set like iron.

00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:42,639
..

00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,909
Watson, the pace quickens.

00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:48,750
The hand behind these tragedies grows bolder.

00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:53,019
We must move with equal speed, lest more lives be claimed.

00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:59,139
And so, with the roar of the waterfall at our backs and the cries of the villagers rising in dread,

00:15:59,139 --> 00:16:04,399
we hastened once more toward the hall, knowing that the heart of the mystery was at last within our grasp.

00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,519
The news of young James Trevor's death spread through the village like fire through dry brush.

00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,169
By the time Holmes and I reached the hall, a grim crowd had already gathered about the stables where the body had been laid.

00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:22,569
Faces bale with horror, peered at us, and whispers followed in our wake, as though we bore the judgment of fate itself.

00:16:22,569 --> 00:16:27,939
The poor lad, hardly twenty, to be cut down in such a fashion is monstrous.

00:16:27,939 --> 00:16:28,960
..

00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:34,069
Monstrous, yes, but not mysterious, at least not in the supernatural sense.

00:16:34,069 --> 00:16:37,319
Come, Watson, let us view the body.

00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,019
The dead, as I often remind you, are eloquent witnesses.

00:16:41,019 --> 00:16:42,159
..

00:16:42,159 --> 00:16:45,490
Within the stable, the curate himself stood bowed with grief,

00:16:45,490 --> 00:16:49,679
his hands trembling over the form of his son, which lay upon a makeshift bierge.

00:16:49,679 --> 00:16:52,909
Holmes removed his hat solemnly and bent over the body.

00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:55,179
his keen eyes missing no detail.

00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:56,919
The skull is fractured.

00:16:56,919 --> 00:16:59,419
He must have strut the rocks below the falls.

00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:00,529
Indeed.

00:17:00,529 --> 00:17:01,769
But see here,

00:17:01,769 --> 00:17:03,529
the bruising upon the wrists,

00:17:03,529 --> 00:17:05,639
the abrasions along the arms.

00:17:05,639 --> 00:17:07,900
These are not the injuries of a fall alone.

00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:09,359
No, Watson.

00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,180
This youth struggled against some restraint

00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,009
before he met his end.

00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:15,480
You mean he was forced?

00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,680
..

00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:17,609
Precisely.

00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:19,000
He was seized,

00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,380
bound perhaps,

00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,730
and then hurled into the torrent.

00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:27,900
This was no accident nor curse, but deliberate murder.

00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,480
A murmur of horror rose among those present.

00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,619
Colonel Stanhope's face darkened as though with storm.

00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,970
Then the fiend walks among us still.

00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:39,070
Tell me, Mr. Holmes, who is guilty of this outrage?

00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:42,799
My household shall not rest until justice is done.

00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:43,940
..

00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,170
Patience, Colonel.

00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:48,579
The truth hides, but it cannot hide long.

00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:52,940
We must ask not only who had the strength to commit this act,

00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:59,480
but who had cause, and who possessed knowledge of the waterfall's secret paths.

00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:04,820
Holmes turned his gaze upon the assembled servants, footmen, maids, and grooms,

00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:07,069
each shrinking back from his piercing eyes.

00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:10,019
Then he addressed them in a voice as calm as it was commanding.

00:18:10,019 --> 00:18:16,889
If any among you knows aught that may bear upon these debts, speak now.

00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:21,920
Silence is complicity, and complicity may in the end prove fatal.

00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,019
..

00:18:23,019 --> 00:18:30,829
Station none spoke though. I detected unease in more than one countenance at last home straightened replaced his hat and motioned me away

00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:33,599
You think one of them is complicit? I

00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:41,039
Think fear seals many mouths Watson, but I also think that the heart of this riddle lies not in

00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,539
whispered superstition but in

00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:46,049
tangible contrivance

00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:49,819
We must return to the Falls at once. Yes

00:18:49,819 --> 00:19:02,000
Once more we braved the gorge, the spray drenching us like rain. Holmes descended with fearless agility, his eyes scanning every inch of the cliff. At a ledge near the water's edge, he gave a cry of triumph.

00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:09,829
Watson, see here iron rods driven into the rock, concealed by moss and spray, and attached.

00:19:09,829 --> 00:19:14,279
Look, fine wires trailing into the torrent.

00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:20,779
This is no natural feature, but an apparatus contrived by human ingenuity.

00:19:20,779 --> 00:19:25,759
But for what purpose? Surely no man could work machinery beneath such a torrent.

00:19:25,759 --> 00:19:30,059
On the contrary, the water itself is the machinery.

00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:38,380
Observe these rods when connected by wire might serve to channel electricity or to create a resonance.

00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,819
The roar of the falls may be used to mask some artificial sound.

00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:47,559
Recall the villagers' tales of voices.

00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:48,619
..

00:19:48,619 --> 00:19:51,659
You suggest those voices were produced, engineered?

00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:57,700
Exactly. Imagine a horn or tube concealed in the rocks conducting sound from some hidden operator.

00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:02,349
A clever trick to instill terror in simple minds.

00:20:02,349 --> 00:20:07,180
And terror, my dear Watson, is a potent weapon.

00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,910
I confess, I shuddered at the thought.

00:20:09,910 --> 00:20:13,080
To turn the very power of nature into an instrument of deception

00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,849
was a devilry worthy of the keenest malice.

00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,800
But who would contrive such a scheme, and why?

00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,740
That is the next link in the chain.

00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:24,700
But mark my words, the motive is not phantoms,

00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:31,420
phantoms, but property, power, or passion. Always the same. Three, Watson.

00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:36,200
As we clambered back to the path, a figure emerged from the trees. It was Miss Mary once

00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:43,170
more, her face pale, her hands clasped tightly together. Mr. Holmes, Dr. Watson, I beg you,

00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:49,640
cease your investigations. Already too many have died. If you persist, I fear you too shall be

00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:56,640
taken. Miss Stanhope, your concern does you credit, yet your words betray knowledge beyond

00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:05,500
mere fear. You know something. Confess it. No, I only that the falls bring doom. I cannot explain

00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:12,820
more. Cannot or will not. Very well, I shall not press you now. But understand this, truth

00:21:12,819 --> 00:21:19,980
concealed breeds only further tragedy. Consider carefully where your silence may lead."

00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,059
She turned away, tears glimmering in her eyes, and hurried back toward the hall. Holmes watched

00:21:25,059 --> 00:21:30,379
her with narrowed gaze. She knows more than she admits, Holmes. Holmes!

00:21:30,379 --> 00:21:38,219
Undoubtedly, she is caught in a net of loyalty and fear. The question is, loyalty to whom?

00:21:38,219 --> 00:21:40,579
To her father? To another?

00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:45,430
That evening, Holmes requested permission of Colonel Stanhope to examine the family archives.

00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:50,470
We were conducted to a goomy chamber lined with ancient ledgers, parchments and maps.

00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:55,000
Holmes set to work with his customary vigor, turning page after page with feverish haste.

00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,900
Ha ha, here Watson, an old survey of the estate.

00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:06,220
Note this passage, subterranean channel connecting the upper stream to the grotto beneath the falls.

00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:12,659
Do you see? There exists a cavern hidden within the cascade itself.

00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:19,720
A cavern? Then a man might lurk there unseen and produce the very voices of which the villagers speak.

00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:21,100
..

00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:29,750
Precisely. And more, he might even contrive to drag his victims into the torrent unseen by those above.

00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,619
The perfect lair for a phantom.

00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:36,099
At that moment, a footstep echoed in the corridor beyond.

00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:39,329
Holmes kills the ledger sharply and motioned me to silence.

00:22:39,329 --> 00:22:43,740
We waited only to hear the soft retreat of someone who had paused at the door.

00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,960
Someone was listening.

00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,039
..

00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,039
Yes, and that someone now knows we are upon descent.

00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,980
..

00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,269
The game quickens, Watson.

00:22:54,269 --> 00:22:57,519
And quicken it did, for scarcely had we retired to our chamber

00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,940
when a cry rang out from below, followed by the crash of breaking gas.

00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:04,140
We rushed down to find the library in disarray, the window shattered,

00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:07,030
and the ledgers we had been studying scattered upon the floor.

00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,800
The lantern lay overturned, its flame narrowly extinguished

00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,850
before it could ignite the papers.

00:23:11,850 --> 00:23:13,620
An attempt to destroy the evidence.

00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:14,660
..

00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:17,610
More than that, it was meant as a warning.

00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:20,619
The enemy grows desperate, Watson.

00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:24,309
But he reveals himself by his very fear.

00:23:24,309 --> 00:23:27,780
We spent the remainder of that night in uneasy vigil.

00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,289
Holmes paced the floor like a caged panther,

00:23:30,289 --> 00:23:31,700
his mind working furiously.

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:38,139
At last, toward dawn, he halted before me, his eyes alight with the fire of resolution.

00:23:38,139 --> 00:23:42,240
Watson, the curtain rises upon the final act.

00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:48,590
I must inspect the cavern beneath the falls, and I must do so this very night.

00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:51,390
But it is perilous in the extreme.

00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:55,630
I shall require your steady hand and your revolver.

00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:58,170
You may rely upon both homes.

00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,299
Where you go, I go.

00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:15,630
I knew I might count upon you, my dear fellow. Then skew yourself, for tonight we enter the very jaws of the so-called curse, and let us see if man's deceit may withstand the gaze of reason.

00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:22,360
Thus, with the roar of the waterfall echoing ever in our ears, we prepared ourselves for the descent into darkness.

00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:27,119
That night, the storm broke over Devonshire with a violence seldom seen.

00:24:27,119 --> 00:24:29,580
The wind ratted shutters and tore at the trees

00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:32,860
while the thunder of the fall seemed doubled by the heavens themselves.

00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:37,910
Yet it was on that wide night that Holmes chose to penetrate the cavern hidden beneath the torrent.

00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:42,360
Armed with lanterns, ropes and my revolver, we set out at midnight from the hall.

00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,099
Colonel Stanhope would have detained us,

00:24:44,099 --> 00:24:48,800
but Holmes merely bowed and assured him that the honour of his house depended upon swift action.

00:24:48,799 --> 00:24:52,099
Miss Mary wept silently at the stairhead as we departed,

00:24:52,099 --> 00:24:56,559
and I confess her pale face haunted me as we strode across the fields.

00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,400
Holmes, do you truly think it wise to attempt this descent in such weather?

00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:03,109
Current will be swollen to madness.

00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:06,389
Precisely why we must attempt it tonight, Watson.

00:25:06,389 --> 00:25:11,440
Our adversary will assume no man dares such a venture in this storm.

00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,880
Secrecy is our ally.

00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,299
Courage, my friend.

00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,569
The truth lies within that roar.

00:25:18,569 --> 00:25:24,409
Reaching the gorge, we found the waterfall a white fury, its spray lashing us like whips.

00:25:24,409 --> 00:25:29,670
Holmes tied a stout rope about his waist and secured it to a tree, then handed me the second length.

00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:36,150
Follow close, Watson. Keep the lantern high, and whatever happens, do not lose your footing.

00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:39,180
The path is narrow, but sound.

00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:43,599
Inch by inch we crept along the slippery ledge, the abyss yawning below.

00:25:43,599 --> 00:25:47,699
At length Holmes pointed to a dark cleft, half hidden by the falling water.

00:25:47,699 --> 00:25:52,710
With a cry he plunged forward, drawing me after, and in an instant we were within a cavern,

00:25:52,710 --> 00:25:56,409
the roar of the cascade forming a thunderous curtain at the entrance.

00:25:56,409 --> 00:26:00,940
By heavens, Holmes, what a place! This drotto might house an army unseen.

00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:07,339
And perhaps it has housed one man, which is enough. Look about you, Watson, observe.

00:26:07,339 --> 00:26:08,599
..

00:26:08,599 --> 00:26:08,799
What?

00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:14,960
The lantern light revealed a chamber carved by nature, yet altered by human hand, heist.

00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,719
Iron rods were fixed in the rock, supporting lengths of wire and tubing.

00:26:18,719 --> 00:26:22,759
At one side lay a crude apparatus of bellows, pipes and a speaking trumpet,

00:26:22,759 --> 00:26:25,859
all cunningly arranged to project sound through the waterfall itself.

00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:29,319
....

00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,559
Then it is true, the voices of the falls were but trickery.

00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:33,599
..

00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:36,960
Ingenious trickery, designed to play upon superstition.

00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:43,750
Observe also these chains and manacles fixed to the wall, tools of coercion.

00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:50,740
Our murderer lured or dragged his victims here, bound them and then cast them into the torrent.

00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,059
Fiendish! But to what end?

00:26:53,059 --> 00:26:54,180
..

00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:57,940
Patience, Watson. Motive must soon declare itself.

00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:02,390
Yet I suspect it lies in the inheritance of the Stanhope estate.

00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,779
Someone profits by the deaths.

00:27:04,779 --> 00:27:10,369
Even as he spoke, a faint sound reached us above the roar, a scrape of stone, a breath.

00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:14,450
Holmes extinguished the lantern with a swift motion, plunging us into darkness.

00:27:14,450 --> 00:27:16,210
We crouched in silence.

00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:21,029
Presently, a figure entered the cavern from a hidden side passage, bearing a lantern of his own.

00:27:21,029 --> 00:27:25,630
In its glow, we beheld a face twisted with malice, the face of Colonel Stanhope Stewart,

00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:29,039
Samuel Price, whom we had been told was the first victim.

00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,819
Holmes, he lives.

00:27:30,819 --> 00:27:31,940
Hush, Watson.

00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:37,140
The man moved to the apparatus, adjusted the tubes and then spoke into the trumpet

00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:42,500
A ghastly wailing issued forth, magnified by the falls, echoing like the voices of the dead

00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:46,600
Another soul for the torrent, another offering to the curse

00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:52,880
At this, Holmes sprang forward, striking the lantern from the fellow's hand and seizing him by the collar

00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,320
I rushed to his aid and together we bore the struggling wretch to the ground

00:27:57,319 --> 00:28:02,419
So, Samuel Price, the ghost returns to life

00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,179
Your masquerade is at an end

00:28:05,179 --> 00:28:08,299
Curse you, Holmes, you meddling devil

00:28:08,299 --> 00:28:10,460
Spare your curses

00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,519
Explain rather how you contrived your false death

00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:16,659
I left my coat and boots at the falls

00:28:16,659 --> 00:28:19,039
Let the villagers think I'd been taken

00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,399
Then I had freedom to work unseen

00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:24,939
They all feared this curse too much to search closely

00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:27,980
Clever, but your purpose?

00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,030
Purpose?

00:28:29,030 --> 00:28:29,340
Huh

00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,660
The colonel's estate

00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,340
Lands rich in tin and copper

00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,180
He would not exploit them

00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,840
But I knew their worth

00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,039
With each death

00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,259
The villagers' terror grew

00:28:38,259 --> 00:28:39,220
And soon

00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,200
Even Stanhope himself would have fled

00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,140
The hall would fall into ruin

00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,720
The land into my hands

00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:45,480
Mine

00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,340
Oh, you madman

00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,019
You murdered innocents for gain

00:28:49,019 --> 00:28:50,519
They were nothing

00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:51,340
Peasants

00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:52,059
A clerk

00:28:52,059 --> 00:28:53,100
The curate's boy

00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,279
I needed their debts

00:28:54,279 --> 00:28:55,680
to keep the legend alive.

00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,899
..

00:28:56,899 --> 00:28:59,639
And so you cloaked greed in superstition.

00:28:59,639 --> 00:29:01,679
But you overreached, Price.

00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,900
Had you not slain the boy,

00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,079
suspicion might never have turned upon the living steward.

00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,059
Holmes bound the fellow swiftly

00:29:10,059 --> 00:29:13,059
with the very chains he had prepared for his victims.

00:29:13,059 --> 00:29:14,590
We dragged him to the entrance,

00:29:14,590 --> 00:29:16,449
where the storm had somewhat abated,

00:29:16,449 --> 00:29:18,680
and by dawn delivered him into the hands of

00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:20,989
Colonel Stanhope and the village constable.

00:29:20,989 --> 00:29:23,099
Price, my own steward,

00:29:23,099 --> 00:29:28,119
the man I trusted above all, to think such villainy lurked beneath my roof.

00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,159
..

00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:35,219
Do not reproach yourself, Colonel. The most venomous snake often wears the smoothest skin.

00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:42,179
Yet the truth is laid bare at last. Mr. Holmes, you have freed us. The curse is broken.

00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:43,619
..

00:29:43,619 --> 00:29:51,439
Nay, Miss Stanhope, the curse never was. Only man's deception, now unmasked. Remember well,

00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,920
Superstition is but the veil

00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:56,519
By which the wicked hide their craft

00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:58,580
The villagers rejoiced

00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:00,240
As though a plague had been lifted

00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:03,039
Yet I could not forget the faces of those poor souls

00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:05,500
Whose lives had been sacrificed to Price's greed

00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,039
Holmes, however, remained calm

00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:09,620
Smoking his pipe as we journeyed back toward London

00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:11,279
You astonish me, Holmes

00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,640
From the first, you suspected mortal hands rather than spectral

00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,960
Yet how could you be certain?

00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,799
Because, my dear Watson

00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,880
Nature is consistent

00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:30,960
water falls rocks endure winds blow but when men die by identical means time after time then man

00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:40,660
not nature is at work to assume otherwise is to abandon reason how gone sir and the voices the

00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:48,480
the supposed curse all contrived elementary optical and acoustic effects watson heightened

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,259
by cunning contrivances. A lantern placed cunningly here, a tube concealed there,

00:30:55,259 --> 00:31:01,019
enough to deceive the ignorant, but not, I trust, a student of deduction.

00:31:01,019 --> 00:31:02,200
..

00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:07,759
Thus ended the mystery of the cursed waterfall. Yet though the apparatus was dismantled and the

00:31:07,759 --> 00:31:12,599
murderer brought to justice, the roar of those falls haunts me still, and whenever I recall the

00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:17,640
silver spray shining in the moonlight, I see again the torched figure of my friend striding fearless

00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:22,280
into peril, armed with nothing but his reason and conquering even the darkest superstition

00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:27,360
with the light of truth. It was with immense relief that I found myself once more in the

00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,220
comfort of our lodgings at 221 B Bake. Hmm, our street, hmm? The cracking of the fire,

00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:38,700
the rattle of handsome gabs upon Baker Street below, and the aromatic haze of Holmes's tobacco

00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,960
combined to assure me that the world had resumed its proper order. Yet my thoughts lingered upon

00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,940
Devonshire, upon the roaring torrent and the shadowy cavern where death had so long held

00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:54,670
dominion. Holmes sat opposite me, stretched languidly in his chair, his eyes half closed,

00:31:54,670 --> 00:31:59,619
his long fingers steeper together. One might have thought him the very picture of indolence.

00:31:59,619 --> 00:32:04,100
Were it not for the faint glimmer of amusement that laid upon his lips, I knew that expression

00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:09,200
well. It signified that my friend awaited my inevitable questions, as a schoolmaster awaits

00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,920
the pupil's stumbling recitation. Holmes, I confess myself bewildered still. You sought

00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,400
through the deception from the first, while I, and indeed the entire countryside, remained

00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:24,940
convinced of supernatural agency. Cammy, how did you so quickly discard the idea of a curse?

00:32:24,940 --> 00:32:32,550
Because, Watson, curses are the province of the imagination, not of fact. I reason thus,

00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:38,680
either the waterfall is in itself an agent of death, in which case the accidents would be

00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:44,880
random and varied, or else some intelligence directs the deaths, in which case they will be

00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:53,180
uniform and purposeful. The three victims perished in identical fashion, struck upon the rocks below.

00:32:53,180 --> 00:33:00,600
Therefore the agency was human. Yet surely the glowing spray, the voices, the taints of villagers,

00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,279
these were convincing enough to any rational mind. Convincing to any mind that relies upon

00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:14,359
impression rather than analysis. Consider, moonlight upon spray will always produce

00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:22,559
spectral effects. As for voices, we have long known the capacity of tubes and trumpets to project

00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:29,000
sound. Behold my remark about the ink-drought in the Colonel's letter, the agitation of a man of

00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,220
discipline. That agitation spoke of mortal terror, not of fanciful curse. Once you have eliminated

00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:42,259
the impossible, Watson. Whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:45,849
Then the steward, Bryce, was your suspect from the first.

00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:53,160
Not my suspect, but my hypothesis. The fact that his death was unconfirmed,

00:33:53,160 --> 00:34:01,600
that no body had been recovered, at once roused my suspicion. Villagers are prone to hysteria,

00:34:01,599 --> 00:34:04,299
and a coat and boots upon the rocks

00:34:04,299 --> 00:34:06,029
suffice to convince them.

00:34:06,029 --> 00:34:10,199
Yet absence of evidence is not evidence of death.

00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:12,380
Thus I reserved judgment

00:34:12,380 --> 00:34:15,369
until the cavern revealed itself.

00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:17,460
I could not but admire the clarity

00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,469
with which he expounded these matters.

00:34:19,469 --> 00:34:21,199
Yet there lingered in me a question

00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,940
that touched not on logic but on humanity.

00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,179
Holmes, do you feel no outrage

00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:27,449
at the cruelty of the man?

00:34:27,449 --> 00:34:30,039
Those poor souls, lured to death for greed,

00:34:30,039 --> 00:34:32,630
Does not such wickedness stir you to anger?

00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,349
Anger clouds.

00:34:34,349 --> 00:34:35,550
Judgment, Watson.

00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:37,649
I prefer cold detachment.

00:34:37,649 --> 00:34:42,559
Thrice is but one more specimen for the cabinet of human folly.

00:34:42,559 --> 00:34:47,239
His avarice, his cunning, his exploitation of superstition,

00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:50,710
all instructive, all lamentably predictable.

00:34:50,710 --> 00:34:55,250
If his crimes excite me at all, it is only as material for study.

00:34:55,250 --> 00:34:56,940
The law will punish him.

00:34:56,940 --> 00:35:02,460
My concern is merely to ensure that the facts are clear.

00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,760
And yet, Melistan hope.

00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,530
Ah, yes, a sensitive soul, torn between loyalty and suspicion.

00:35:10,530 --> 00:35:12,769
She guessed more than she admitted.

00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:17,909
But her silence was born of filial duty, not guilt.

00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,890
I trust she will recover her peace,

00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:24,480
now that the shadow has lifted from her father's house.

00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:31,220
I pondered his words in silence. In his left, to me, the case was filled with human tragedy and pathos.

00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,869
To Holmes, it was but a demonstration of principles.

00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:39,369
Yet perhaps it was this wedding detachment that allowed him to pierce the veil of deceit when others faltered.

00:35:39,369 --> 00:35:43,699
One lesson I draw from this, Holmes, is how perilous superstition can be.

00:35:43,699 --> 00:35:48,960
Honest men and women, driven by fear of a phantom, allowed themselves to be blinded to the truth.

00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:58,079
Exactly so. Superstition is but the abdication of reason. A cunning rogue has but to whisper

00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:05,760
of a curse, and men will see ghosts where there are only shadows, hear voices where there is only

00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:13,360
wind, and yield their judgment into another's hands. You, Watson, as a medical man, must combat

00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:19,980
such weakness as surely as I combat crime. Science is the antidote to fear.

00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:25,199
He rose and paced the room, his dressing gown flowing about him like a scholar's robe,

00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:30,960
his voice animated now with that peculiar energy which seized him whenever a case had

00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,079
reached its conclusion. Observe the progression, Watson. First, the legend of the gypsy woman,

00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:44,719
of fertile soil into this soil. Price sought terror by feigning his own death. Next he

00:36:44,719 --> 00:36:52,000
contrived voices by means of tubes, and spectral light by lantern and moon. Then emboldened he

00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:57,799
struck down those who strayed near the falls, thus strengthening the illusion of supernatural

00:36:57,799 --> 00:37:06,739
vengeance. It is the very anatomy of fraud, legend, illusion, and murder, each feeding upon

00:37:06,739 --> 00:37:12,639
the last. And yet, but for your intervention, he might have succeeded. The colonel might have

00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:19,939
abandoned his estate, and price seized his mineral riches. True, but fraud always contains the seed

00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:27,779
of its own destruction. Trice grew reckless, and in slaying the curate's son, he provoked inquiry

00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:36,579
from outside. Thus, crime ever defeats itself in the end. I sat long into the night, after Holmes

00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:41,670
had retired, reflecting upon the strange adventure we had shared, ticked in the roar of the waterfall,

00:37:41,670 --> 00:37:46,849
I seemed still to hear the cries of the victims, yet mingled with them was the calm voice of Holmes,

00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:52,840
dissecting illusion with scalpel-like precision. And I thought to myself that if ever posterity

00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:57,840
should know of these adventures, it must know not only the triumphs of reason, but also the

00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:03,059
shadows of human passion, against which reason contends. For though Holmes was right to dismiss

00:38:03,059 --> 00:38:08,829
the curse as fiction, the fear it inspired was no less real, and in that fear lay tragedy.

00:38:08,829 --> 00:38:13,699
Thus I set pen to paper to record the case of the cursed waterfall, hoping that it may stand as

00:38:13,699 --> 00:38:18,579
both a warning and a lesson, a warning against the dangers of credulity, and a lesson in the

00:38:18,579 --> 00:38:24,960
power of clear deduction. Horms, I murmured at last, as sleep stole over me. It is indeed as you

00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,299
say, everything is elementary, when once you show the chain, this, but for me, the word will always

00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:34,450
hold mysteries, so long as men are moved by terror and by greed.

00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:38,400
Then Watson came his voice from the shadows.

00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:43,690
The world shall never lack for work for you and me.

00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:49,240
And with that, the fire sank low, the city outside hummed on, and another chapter closed

00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,640
in the chroniclers of Sherlock Holmes.

00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:50,860
.
