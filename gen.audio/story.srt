00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
It is among the peculiar fortunes of my life that I should have been permitted to record so many of.

00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:08,359
The adventures of Sherlock Holmes, Sashlock Holmes,

00:00:08,359 --> 00:00:12,900
whose genius for observation and deduction has seldom, if ever, been equal.

00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,839
Many of these cases have lain unpublished for years,

00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,189
whether through the delicacy of those involved or the simple eccentricity of my friend,

00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,549
who often regarded publicity with disdain.

00:00:22,549 --> 00:00:27,780
But there are others, hidden in my notes, which I now feel compelled to bring to light.

00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,560
One of these is what I have called the adventure of the doing suitcase,

00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:35,939
a mystery that began with the most unexpected visitation to our lodgings in Baker Street

00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:39,219
on a fog-shrouded evening in the autumn of 1887.

00:00:39,219 --> 00:00:40,280
..

00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,100
Holmes was, at that time, immersed in one of his chemical experiments

00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,520
involving a retort of bubbling liquid that hissed ominously

00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,159
whenever he added a pinch of some crystalline powder.

00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:54,680
The air of our sitting room was thick with an acrid smoke which brought tears to my eyes

00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,480
and compelled me to retreat behind my medical journal,

00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:00,280
though my friend seemed quite oblivious to its effects.

00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:03,179
His long fingers moved with the delicacy of a surgeon

00:01:03,179 --> 00:01:06,450
as he measured, stirred and observed the strange reaction,

00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:10,810
humming to himself in that low tone he reserved for moments of complete concentration.

00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:13,439
Holmes, I really must protest that your laboratory practices

00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,990
will be the ruin of both our lungs, bro-jay.

00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:18,729
This room is already close to unbearable.

00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:19,800
It bearable.

00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:20,620
Some...

00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:21,980
My dear Watson,

00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:26,460
A man's lungs are robust enough to withstand a little chlorine vapour.

00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,740
...

00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:33,380
Whereas the mind is far more fragile and requires constant exercise

00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:36,240
if it is not to wither into flabbiness.

00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,790
Yet you will forgive me if I confess that I do not see how breeding poison gas can possibly improve one's mental faculties.

00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:46,640
Ah, but there you are, my good fellow.

00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,480
This experiment is a test of certain phosphorescent compounds

00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:59,840
and from it we may gain an insight into the curious behavior of matter when stimulated by chemical energy.

00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,939
In such investigations lies the seed of deductions which may one day solve a case of crime most singular.

00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:08,039
..

00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,340
Kohns' pronouncements, as ever, struck me as at once maddening and profound.

00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:16,120
I had learned long ago that it was useless to debate his peculiar hobbies.

00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,399
It was at that moment, however, that our conversation was interrupted by a loud knock at the door below.

00:02:21,399 --> 00:02:33,120
Mrs. Hudson's familiar tread ascended the staircase, and presently she ushered into our room a visitor whose appearance was so remarkable that I instantly set down my journal and gave him my full attention.

00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,819
The man was tall, though slightly stooped, with garments of fine cut, but sadly neglected condition.

00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:47,879
His hair, which might once have been fair, was streaked with grey, and his eyes darted about the room with a nervous energy that bespoke intense agitation.

00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:52,769
Most striking of all, however, was the object he carried, a large leather suitcase,

00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:58,930
which he bore with both hands as though it were a treasure of immense value or a burden of unbearable weight.

00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,329
Gentlemen, forgive me for intruding at such an hour, but I have come to you in desperation.

00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,599
My name is Arthur Phelps and I am in dire need of Mr. Sherlock Holmes' advice.

00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,859
You could not have come at a better time, Mr. Phelps.

00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:19,860
Pray, be seated, and do not hesitate to place that curious case upon the table.

00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:29,270
My friend and colleague Dr. Watson will vouch that no circumstance, however strange, is without its proper explanation,

00:03:29,270 --> 00:03:34,090
if only we apply the powers of observation and deduction.

00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:36,850
You seem in considerable distress, sir.

00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:41,580
Perhaps, if you begin at the beginning, we may the better understand what assistance you require.

00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,689
Mr. Arthur Phelps placed the suitcase on our table with an audible thud.

00:03:45,689 --> 00:03:50,020
I was startled to perceive that a faint glow seemed to emanate from the seams of the leather,

00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,289
as though some hidden light pulsed within.

00:03:52,289 --> 00:03:54,879
The effect was ghostly and most uncanny,

00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:58,909
casting a pale radiance upon Holmes' thin, hawk-like features.

00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:01,719
You observe it at once, Doctor.

00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,519
That glow has been the torment of my existence these past three nights.

00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,360
It began after the case came into my possession,

00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,760
and I swear to you, I have not dared to open it.

00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,420
Surely you know what the suitcase contains?

00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,870
That, sir, is the riddle.

00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,670
The case was delivered to my residence without explanation,

00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:21,620
sealed and addressed in my name.

00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:24,110
There was no letter, no sender,

00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:26,439
and when the lights of my chamber were extinguished,

00:04:26,439 --> 00:04:30,060
I perceived this infernal glow seeping from within.

00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,080
..

00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,850
Fascinating.

00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,759
The glow, Watson, is unmistakably chemical in nature,

00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,529
phosphorescence perhaps, or some other luminescent reaction confined within.

00:04:41,529 --> 00:04:45,399
Observe the manner in which the seams pulse rhythmically,

00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:47,829
almost as though the thing were breathing.

00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,959
That detail alone rules out any ordinary cause.

00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:54,699
Holmes, I cannot deny the effect is unsettling.

00:04:54,699 --> 00:04:58,699
It seems unnatural, as though the case harboured some living creature.

00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:04,939
And yet, my good fellow, to suppose it harbours life is to leap beyond the evidence.

00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:09,550
Mr. Phelps, you say this case was delivered to you.

00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,300
By what means precisely?

00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,579
..

00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:17,560
By a cabman, sir, who claimed he had been instructed by a gentleman he could not describe.

00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,579
He handed me the case, accepted no fee and vanished before I could press him with questions.

00:05:21,579 --> 00:05:22,860
..

00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:27,129
A cabman who accepts no fare is an anomaly indeed.

00:05:27,129 --> 00:05:28,300
Note that, Watson.

00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,839
It suggests the fellow was in the employ of another,

00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:38,060
perhaps under strict orders to deliver his charge without engaging in conversation.

00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,319
..

00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,179
And since then you have not opened the suitcase though it bears your name?

00:05:43,179 --> 00:05:46,029
No, doctor. My courage failed me.

00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:49,679
At first I thought it some ghastly trick but each night the glow intensifies

00:05:49,679 --> 00:05:52,519
and last evening I swear I heard a faint humming from within

00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:55,159
like the murmur of bees behind a wall.

00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:59,459
Most intriguing. Tell me, Mr. Phelps, what is your occupation?

00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,839
...

00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:05,389
I am employed at the Foreign Office, sir, in a rather humble capacity,

00:06:05,389 --> 00:06:08,699
though I am sometimes entrusted with confidential documents.

00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,669
Ah, that alters the complexion of the case considerably.

00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:17,199
You will agree, Watson, that the sudden arrival of a mysterious case

00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:23,500
addressed to a government official must be weighed in the balance of international intrigue.

00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,779
Indeed, Holmes, I cannot help but think of spies and agents seeking to convey some perilous device.

00:06:28,779 --> 00:06:34,529
Just so. Mr. Phelps, have you enemies, either personal or political?

00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:40,799
None that I know of, sir. My life is of the quietest, and I have never sought prominence.

00:06:40,799 --> 00:06:46,699
Yet prominence may have sought you, if you have handled certain papers of value.

00:06:46,699 --> 00:06:51,079
.....

00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:56,399
Very well. If the first step is clear, Watson, hand me my lens.

00:06:56,399 --> 00:07:01,079
We shall subject this suitcase to the most careful examination.

00:07:01,079 --> 00:07:09,099
Though I warn you both, I will not yet open it until I have exhausted every possible observation of its exterior.

00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:26,399
..................

00:07:26,399 --> 00:07:29,679
himself in rapid phrases I could scarcely follow.

00:07:29,679 --> 00:07:33,599
Note the absence of scratches about the lock, Watson.

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,039
This tells us that our client has spoken the truth.

00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,799
He has not attempted to force it.

00:07:39,799 --> 00:07:45,659
Observe also this faint residue upon the handle, a powdery substance, faintly luminous in its

00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:46,979
own right.

00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:53,919
This is no mere trick of reflection, but a true phosphor compound, of which very few

00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:54,919
are known.

00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:59,000
Then the glow is intentional, Holmes, a device prepared by some chemist?

00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,629
Precisely so.

00:08:00,629 --> 00:08:05,639
The question becomes, what motive lies behind such an elaborate contrivance?

00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:12,319
To inspire fear, to conceal a treasure, or to serve as a signal visible at night?

00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:13,379
..

00:08:13,379 --> 00:08:18,139
You speak of it so calmly, Mr. Holmes, while to me it has been a torment beyond endurance.

00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:19,379
..

00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:23,220
Calmness, my dear sir, is the true ally of reason.

00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:26,020
Fear is the enemy of deduction

00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:29,480
Rest assured, before the night is over

00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:34,700
We shall know far more of this singular object than we do now

00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:37,000
Holmes straightened at last

00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,139
His eyes alight with the fire of discovery

00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:39,910
Pot!

00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:41,399
And I could see that to him

00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:43,940
The Bueing suitcase was not an object of terror

00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,279
But a fascination

00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:48,740
A challenge to be unraveled by the tools of science and logic

00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,840
He moved to the mantel

00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,540
Lit his pipe with deliberate care

00:08:51,539 --> 00:08:54,629
and sent up three puffs of smoke before speaking again.

00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:56,950
Hmm. Mr. Hmm.

00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,319
Phelps, I must ask whether any of your colleagues at the Foreign Office

00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:05,730
might bear ill will toward you or be tempted by bribery.

00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:09,459
Even the humblest clerk may stumble upon a document

00:09:09,459 --> 00:09:13,179
whose value is beyond reckoning to a foreign power.

00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:19,319
I have considered that possibility, Mr. N.O. Mabel, Citrio 4, Citrio 4, Holmes.

00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:22,440
but I cannot think of one who would single me out in such a manner.

00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,460
..

00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:28,540
And yet here we are with an inexplicable object thrust into your possession.

00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:30,629
No coincidence, Watson.

00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:35,990
In matters of this sort, coincidence is the mask of design.

00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:38,180
Then you suspect espionage, Holmes?

00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:41,080
I suspect nothing, I observe.

00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:46,960
And what I observe is that the sender of this suitcase has gone to extraordinary lengths

00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:53,259
to ensure it reaches Mr. Phelps intact, unmolested and glowing

00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:56,350
with an aura designed to confound.

00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:00,580
That suggests intelligence and deliberate planning.

00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:04,000
What we must uncover is the purpose.

00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,220
..

00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,330
The gyo from the suitcase seemed to brighten as Holmes spoke,

00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,860
as though mocking our ignorance.

00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,639
Mr. Phelps sat wringing his hands, his face pale in the ghastly light.

00:10:14,639 --> 00:10:16,840
For my part, I could not suppress a shiver.

00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,910
though I told myself it was only the late autumn chill seeping through the window panes.

00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:25,840
The reader will recall that we had reached the point where Mr. Mind, where Mr. Arthur Phelps,

00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:30,080
a clerk in the foreign office, had placed upon our table a suitcase that glowed with a mysterious

00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,700
inner light. Holmes, after a minute examination, had pronounced the effect chemical in origin,

00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:39,450
though its purpose remained uncertain. The tension of that first evening did not diminish.

00:10:39,450 --> 00:10:43,960
Indeed, as the clock chimed nine, I felt that the very walls of Baker Street vibrated

00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,269
with the unspoken promise of danger.

00:10:46,269 --> 00:10:48,610
Holmes alone appeared supremely at ease,

00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:51,400
puffing upon his pipe while Mr. Delejust Desham

00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,530
felt sat in visible torment.

00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:58,320
Watson, be so good as to recording your notebook

00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,139
the precise description of our client's visitor.

00:11:02,139 --> 00:11:04,350
The Gabman!

00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:06,779
You will recall, Mr. Phelps,

00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:10,650
every detail you can of this mysterious fellow,

00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,160
no matter how trivial.

00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:18,679
It was dark, sir, and the fog thick, but I remember his voice rough, London-born, and

00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:19,539
tinged with cottony.

00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:23,039
His coat was of shabby brown, and he wore a cap pull low.

00:11:23,039 --> 00:11:25,450
Beyond that, I cannot say.

00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:27,210
That would suffice.

00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:29,839
A cabman of the old school, no doubt.

00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,519
Note it down, Watson.

00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,990
The absence of payment is key.

00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,769
Our driver was employed under orders, and orders always leave a trail.

00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:42,190
Cabs may vanish into the fog,

00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:46,559
but their numbers remain written in the ledgers of the city.

00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,759
Then you propose to track him through the registry?

00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:49,779
..

00:11:49,779 --> 00:11:50,620
Precisely.

00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:54,860
Tomorrow, Watson, we shall make a pilgrimage to the cab yard.

00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:58,259
But before that, there is work to be done this evening.

00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:03,179
I must learn whether the glow is merely surface phosphorescence

00:12:03,179 --> 00:12:06,990
or if it originates from within the case itself.

00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:09,200
You will not open it, Mr. Holmes.

00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:26,200
not yet my dear sir to open a sealed container without knowledge of its contents is folly of the worst order it may be harmless or it may be a device contrived to injure patience is the ally of safety

00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:31,289
Holmes drew from his cabinet a small glass prism and a handheld spectroscope of his own design.

00:12:31,289 --> 00:12:35,330
He set these upon the table beside the suitcase and adjusted the lamp,

00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,830
so that the faint glow from the seams might be refracted through the instrument.

00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:42,700
I watched, fascinated, as he bent his keen eyes to the lens.

00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:48,019
As I suspected, Watson, the glow is of a narrow spectral band.

00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:51,340
It corresponds to the emission of phosphorus compounds,

00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,840
but the purity suggests refinement beyond the reach of an amateur.

00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,170
Someone with training in chemistry has arranged this.

00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,870
Observe the steadiness of the glow.

00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:08,779
It does not fade as common phosphors do, but maintains a regular intensity.

00:13:08,779 --> 00:13:11,630
Ah, this is deliberate.

00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:15,110
Then we are dealing with a chemist of some ability, Holmes.

00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:20,500
More than ability precision that limits the field of possible culprits,

00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:24,870
Ah, not many in London could contrive such an effect.

00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:28,059
But what purpose could such a strange contrivance serve?

00:13:28,059 --> 00:13:33,859
We must resist the temptation to leap ahead of the evidence, Mr. Feltz.

00:13:33,859 --> 00:13:36,069
Purpose will emerge in due time.

00:13:36,069 --> 00:13:41,759
For now, the glow itself is a clue, an unmistakable signature.

00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:46,779
Someone wanted you, and only you, to have this suitcase

00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:49,100
and to be tormented by its appearance.

00:13:49,100 --> 00:14:02,100
The unease in the room was palpable. I confess that the ghastly glow seemed to have settled into my very nerves, and I could not shake the impression that the suitcase was something alive. Holmes, however, resumed his seat with perfect composure.

00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,710
Watson, tomorrow you and I shall rise early.

00:14:06,710 --> 00:14:10,430
There is a cabman to be found, Mr. Salmon.

00:14:10,430 --> 00:14:13,840
Perhaps I advise you to remain here tonight.

00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:17,799
You will be safer under my roof than in your own lodgings,

00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,680
which may well be under observation.

00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:24,650
The case will remain here under my protection.

00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:27,560
I am grateful beyond words, Mr. Holmes.

00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,879
Thus it was arranged.

00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,600
That night I slept fitfully in the guest chamber

00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,319
for I could not banish the eerie image of the going case from my thoughts.

00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,950
It seemed to pulse in my dreams like a phantom heart beating in the silence of the night.

00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:44,190
The following morning dawned bleak and drizzly, yet Hones was in his element.

00:14:44,190 --> 00:14:46,899
He strode forth into the mist with his coat buttoned to the chin

00:14:46,899 --> 00:14:49,589
and his cane tapping briskly upon the pavement.

00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:52,950
I accompanied him faithfully, though with less enthusiasm,

00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:57,539
and we soon reached a yard where dozens of handsome cabs stood in grim procession,

00:14:57,539 --> 00:15:00,360
their drivers lounging about with pipes and muds of tea.

00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:06,230
Good morning, gentlemen. I am in search of a driver who, three nights past,

00:15:06,230 --> 00:15:10,580
conveyed a parcel to Bedford Square without accepting a fare.

00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:16,639
A singular circumstance, and one which must surely have been remarked upon.

00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,980
Well now, governor, that rings a bell, it does.

00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:24,440
Jim Hardy, that be the chap, took a queer box to some gentleman's door

00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,039
and wouldn't take so much as a penny for his trouble.

00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:29,940
Said his instructions was clear as daylight.

00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:34,039
Excellent! And where may I find this Mr. Hardy?

00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:39,399
You'll catch him of an evening at the Red Lion Tavern, down near Holborn.

00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:44,039
My thanks! You have rendered a service to justice today.

00:15:44,039 --> 00:15:49,000
With this clue in hand, Holmes led me away, his eyes gleaming with anticipation.

00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,680
Holmes, do you truly believe this cabman will yield us the truth?

00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,840
Every man yields the truth, Watson, though it must sometimes be coaxed by the right method.

00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:03,490
Tonight we shall pay a visit to the Red Lion.

00:16:03,490 --> 00:16:06,490
Evening found us in that smoky establishment,

00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,990
the air thick with the odour of ale and the clamour of voices.

00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:14,160
In one dim corner sat a burly fellow with a cap pull low,

00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:17,370
whose weathered face betrayed a life upon the streets.

00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,900
Holmes approached with his customary directness.

00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,460
You are Jim Hardy, I believe,

00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:26,250
that cabman who delivered the case to Bedford Square three nights ago?

00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:29,269
Aye, that's me. And what of it, sir?

00:16:29,269 --> 00:16:35,090
What of it is that the case you delivered is of the utmost importance?

00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,840
Tell me who employed you, and you may save yourself considerable trouble.

00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,529
Trouble, is it? Well, I know naught of the matter.

00:16:44,529 --> 00:16:48,230
A gent with a muffler over his face hailed me near King's Cross,

00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:51,900
put the case in me cap, and told me to deliver it to that address.

00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,790
He paid me handsome due, more than a month's fares.

00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:12,460
said not to take payment at the door that's the long and short of it did you catch his voice his manner anything distinctive deep voice foreign perhaps though i couldn't swear walked with a bit of a limb i think ebb to the shadows

00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:24,019
foreign and limping most instructive did you see from which train he came at king's cross that i did not sir he was already on the pavement when i arrived

00:17:24,019 --> 00:17:33,240
very well mr hardy your honesty does you credit keep yourself available for the matter may yet require further testimony

00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,160
Holmes pressed a coin into the man's palm and withdrew

00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,740
His face, as we stepped again into the fog

00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:43,539
was alight with that peculiar satisfaction he reserved for a trail that had grown warm

00:17:43,539 --> 00:17:46,299
Holmes, you look as though the game were afoot

00:17:46,299 --> 00:17:48,779
Indeed, Watson, it is

00:17:48,779 --> 00:17:50,819
A foreigner with a limp

00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,079
employing a phosphorescent device

00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:55,640
and targeting a clerk in the foreign office

00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:59,000
Already the outlines of the picture begin to form

00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,009
Hence, the next step will be to examine Mr. Phelps' position more closely.

00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:12,159
There may be documents he has handled in recent weeks which are of value to a foreign power.

00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:18,909
And so, when we returned to Baker Street, Holmes set about interrogating Mr. Phelps with relentless precision,

00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:24,779
drawing forth every detail of his duties, the documents entrusted to him and the colleagues with whom he had contact.

00:18:24,779 --> 00:18:31,139
There was perhaps one matter, a memorandum concerning new telegraph codes, of which I

00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,700
made a fair copy for my superior.

00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,639
It was not of great importance, or so I thought.

00:18:37,639 --> 00:18:44,279
On the contrary, Mr. Feltz, to a foreign agent new codes are of supreme importance.

00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:48,859
A single cipher broken and whole networks may collapse.

00:18:48,859 --> 00:18:54,559
This suitcase, therefore, may be either a lure or a warning.

00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:57,869
A warning, Holmes, but from whom and to what end?

00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,579
That, Watson, is the heart of the mystery.

00:19:01,579 --> 00:19:05,420
Was the glowing case meant to frighten our client into silence

00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:07,509
or to draw him into some trap?

00:19:07,509 --> 00:19:10,159
Until we open it, we cannot see.

00:19:10,159 --> 00:19:14,730
But rest assured, we shall open it when the time is right.

00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:17,170
Thus part two of the affair concluded,

00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:19,250
with the suitcase still locked upon our table,

00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,019
glowing with its eerie light,

00:19:21,019 --> 00:19:23,399
while Holmes's mind whirled with deductions

00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,750
and I, for my part, would only marvel at the strange net of intrigue into which we had been drawn.

00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:33,950
The suitcase remained upon our sitting-room table, like a silent sentinel,

00:19:33,950 --> 00:19:39,780
its glow casting strange shadows upon the bookshelves and the familiar clutter of our Baker Street lodgings.

00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,860
For three nights it had pulsed with that uncanny radiance,

00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,599
yet Holmes had resisted the temptation to force the lock.

00:19:45,599 --> 00:19:49,120
His restraint, I must admit, was a source of frustration to me,

00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,160
though he assured me repeatedly that patience was as necessary in detection

00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:55,350
as courage upon the battlefield.

00:19:55,350 --> 00:20:00,000
Watson, to fling open this case without precaution

00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,360
would be the act of a fool.

00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,000
It may contain documents of state

00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:08,160
or it may contain something designed

00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,910
to destroy those who pry.

00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:13,519
Only by approaching it scientifically

00:20:13,519 --> 00:20:17,140
can we assure both safety and certainty.

00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,240
..

00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,300
I grant you the necessity of caution, Holmes.

00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:24,409
Hymns, yet I confess the suspense has gnawed at me most cruelly.

00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:27,130
I feel as though that case has watched us these three nights,

00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,369
like a beast crouched in the corner.

00:20:29,369 --> 00:20:33,069
A beast, perhaps, but a chained one, my dear fellow.

00:20:33,069 --> 00:20:36,019
Let us unchain it with the proper tools.

00:20:36,019 --> 00:20:39,359
On the morning of the fourth day, Holmes dispatched a deli-glam

00:20:39,359 --> 00:20:43,119
to a colleague of his acquaintance at St. Z, Bartholomew's laboratory,

00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,320
requesting certain apparatus, coys.

00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:49,460
By afternoon, these had arrived, rubber gloves, a set of delicate forceps,

00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:52,960
a shallow basin of sand and a large bell jar of thick glass.

00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,440
The appearance of these objects did little to soothe Mr. Phelps

00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,829
who paced the carpet with restless steps.

00:20:58,829 --> 00:21:01,869
Mr. Holmes, if it is indeed some infernal device,

00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:04,740
I fear the consequences of meddling with it.

00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:06,880
Should we not rather consign it to the authorities?

00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,019
..

00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:14,000
And thereby warn those very persons who may be seeking to undermine your department?

00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,160
No, Mr. Phelps!

00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,700
To thrust this into official hands would be to lose all chance of independent deduction.

00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:29,040
The matter is safest here, where science and reason may probe it undisturbed.

00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:46,160
..................

00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:59,400
now watson observe i shall attempt first to test for fumes a fine puncture through the lever with this hollow needle and we shall know whether anything volatile lies within

00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:11,680
he worked with steady hand clicking the side of the case and attaching the needle to a small tube which led into a dish of pure water for seven minutes we watched breathless but no bubble rose no vapour escaped

00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:28,299
satisfactory there is no gaseous trap the next test is for weight watson lift it gently i did so and was surprised to find it heavier than i expected it must be full of something dense holmes it is far too heavy for papers alone

00:22:28,299 --> 00:22:31,719
Precisely. That tells us much.

00:22:31,719 --> 00:22:33,339
Now, for the lock.

00:22:33,339 --> 00:22:35,319
Observe the workmanship.

00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:39,279
It is common brass, of a type sold at many shops,

00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:41,859
yet it has been oiled recently.

00:22:41,859 --> 00:22:45,799
That suggests it was sealed only a short time ago.

00:22:45,799 --> 00:22:47,639
..

00:22:47,639 --> 00:22:50,809
Very well. We shall open it under the jar.

00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,720
Stand ready, Watson.

00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,339
With deft movements, Holmes inserted his pick and warped the mechanism.

00:22:56,339 --> 00:23:00,179
The click of the lock releasing echoed unnaturally in the silence.

00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:06,150
He withdrew the pick and with slow deliberation lifted the lid of the case beneath the safety of the bell jar.

00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:14,329
Once the blow burst forth more fiercely, flooding the jar with a greenish light that illuminated Holmes' sharp profile like a lantern held from within.

00:23:14,329 --> 00:23:15,980
Good heavens, Holmes!

00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:17,819
Saints preserve us.

00:23:17,819 --> 00:23:26,309
Within the suitcase lay a strange object, a box of polished metal upon which was set a series of glass tubes filled with some luminescent substance.

00:23:26,309 --> 00:23:33,099
Tubes glowed with steady brilliance and tiny wires ran between them to a small coil of copper at one side.

00:23:33,099 --> 00:23:39,799
Remarkable! An electrical phosphorescent apparatus. Quite ingenious!

00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:47,049
Someone has contrived to sustain the glow by a concealed battery and a chemical compound.

00:23:47,049 --> 00:23:53,750
This is no ordinary contrivance, but the work of an expert in experimental physics.

00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:57,969
But why encase such a thing in a suitcase and deliver it to our client?

00:23:57,969 --> 00:24:01,389
That is the heart of the puzzle, Watson.

00:24:01,389 --> 00:24:05,699
Observe further beneath the apparatus lies a bundle of papers.

00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:07,879
Yes, here they are.

00:24:07,879 --> 00:24:11,019
Holmes drew forth several documents sealed with red tape.

00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:12,929
He spread them upon the table by Mr.

00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:14,099
Why, Mr.

00:24:14,099 --> 00:24:16,679
Phelps bent forward anxiously.

00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:19,799
My God, those are drafts of the telegraph code.

00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:22,079
They should be in the custody of my superior.

00:24:22,079 --> 00:24:23,920
yet here they lie before me.

00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:28,289
Indeed, it seems, Mr. Febbs,

00:24:28,289 --> 00:24:34,899
that you have been made the unwilling custodian of contraband of the highest order.

00:24:34,899 --> 00:24:39,269
Whoever placed this case in your hands intended you to be suspected of theft.

00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:44,240
Should the papers be discovered, it is a trap most devilish in its cunning.

00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,259
..

00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:47,480
Then our client stands in glaive peril, Holmes.

00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,079
If the authorities knew of this, suspicion would fall upon him at once.

00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:58,859
Precisely, which is why we must move swiftly. Already the trail grows cold. The cabman's

00:24:58,859 --> 00:25:05,489
employer, the foreigner with the limp, is the key. We must identify him before he strikes again.

00:25:05,489 --> 00:25:10,409
But what of the apparatus? What am I to do with these cursed documents?

00:25:10,409 --> 00:25:17,019
Leave them in my keeping, Mr. Phelps. Yeah, they shall be restored to their rightful place

00:25:17,019 --> 00:25:20,150
once I have traced the chain to its origin.

00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,859
As for the apparatus, it is a signal.

00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:24,220
Make no mistake.

00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:26,730
The girl was intended to be seen,

00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,799
perhaps by an accomplice,

00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,199
watching from without your window.

00:25:31,199 --> 00:25:34,859
He would know the case had reached its destination.

00:25:34,859 --> 00:25:38,069
Then, Viva Azad's observed homes?

00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,369
Possibly.

00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:42,319
Baker Street is not immune to eyes in the dark.

00:25:42,319 --> 00:25:46,650
We must therefore act as though every move is watched.

00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:53,119
The thought sent a chill through me to think that even in our sanctuary we might be under surveillance was unnerving indeed.

00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:56,110
Holmes, however, seemed invigorated by the challenge.

00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:59,309
Watson, you will accompany me this evening.

00:25:59,309 --> 00:26:04,449
There is a man in the East End, an electrician of dubious reputation,

00:26:04,449 --> 00:26:08,400
who may have had the skill to construct such a device.

00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,099
His name is Zacharias Holt.

00:26:10,099 --> 00:26:13,690
If my deductions are correct, he may also limp.

00:26:13,690 --> 00:26:15,400
Then tonight we hunt our quarry?

00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:19,360
Tonight, my dear fellow, the game is truly afoot.

00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:45,400
...........................

00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:52,800
cracks. Horns knocked sharply. Open in the name of business. Who's there? I keep no eyes for strangers.

00:26:52,800 --> 00:27:00,490
A fellow in need of certain huminescent compounds, Mr. Holt. Or shall I call you by another name,

00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:07,019
the limping gentleman of King's Cross? There was a sudden scraping within. Then the door opened a

00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:12,540
crack. A man stood revealed, thin as a whip, his left leg dragging slightly as he shifted his weight.

00:27:12,539 --> 00:27:15,960
His face was pale, his eyes quick and suspicious.

00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,720
You are mistaken, sir. I am no cab-haunter.

00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,259
..

00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:20,859
Mistaken?

00:27:20,859 --> 00:27:22,159
..

00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,619
Then perhaps you can explain

00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:27,899
why the phosphorescent mixture in your window display

00:27:27,899 --> 00:27:30,099
is identical in spectrum

00:27:30,099 --> 00:27:35,139
to that found upon the suitcase handle of Mr. Arthur Phelps.

00:27:35,139 --> 00:27:38,719
Holt started visibly, his eyes darting to left and right,

00:27:38,719 --> 00:27:40,059
as though seeking escape.

00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,279
Holmes, he means to flee.

00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:46,029
Not while your stout frame blocks the door, Watson.

00:27:46,029 --> 00:27:53,230
Mister, hold. I suggest you come quietly, for I assure you the net is already around you.

00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:57,599
You meddle in affairs beyond your ken. Do you think you can stop what has already begun?

00:27:57,599 --> 00:28:00,460
That remains to be seen.

00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,579
You will accompany us to Baker Street, where you will answer certain questions.

00:28:05,579 --> 00:28:10,630
Refuse, and I hand you to Scotland Yard this very night.

00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:15,360
The man glared at Holmes, but at last his shoulders sagged in resignation.

00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,289
With a limp more pronounced than before, he stepped into the street.

00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,829
Thus we secured our first tangible suspect,

00:28:20,829 --> 00:28:24,099
though what further secrets he might reveal was yet to be determined.

00:28:24,099 --> 00:28:27,900
It was with no small sense of triumph that Holmes and I returned to Baker Street

00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:32,259
with our reluctant, hmm, companion, hmm, Zacharias hold.

00:28:32,259 --> 00:28:36,760
The man shuffled along beside us, his limp accentuated by every step,

00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:40,070
his pale face betraying a mixture of defiance and dread,

00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:43,840
The fog still clung to the city, muffling the sound of the handsome weeds,

00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,730
so that it seemed we travelled in some spectral procession.

00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:50,329
Mr. Holmes, Arthur Phelps awaited us anxiously in our rooms,

00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:53,980
his eyes widening in astonishment at the sight of our prisoner.

00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,759
Good heavens, Mr. Holmes, who is this?

00:28:56,759 --> 00:29:00,200
A man of science, Mr. Phelps,

00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:05,940
though his talents have strayed from the laboratory into darker employments.

00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:12,840
Mr. Zacharias Holt, known in certain circles as an electrician of ingenuity

00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:19,920
and known to us as the builder of the phosphorescent device we discovered within your suitcase.

00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,120
..

00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,099
He denied his guilt when we confronted him, Holmes.

00:29:24,099 --> 00:29:30,269
Naturally, Watson. A guilty man seldom proclaims himself so at threshold.

00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:34,380
But denial is a fragile shield against deduction.

00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,170
Now, Mr. Holt, sit here by the fire and let us converse plainly.

00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:45,240
Holt dropped heavily into the chair, his long fingers twitching upon his knees.

00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:50,519
His eyes flickered nervously toward the bewing suitcase still under the bell jar upon the table.

00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:53,640
You built that apparatus, did you not?

00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,440
Do not waste our time with falsehoods.

00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,420
The spectrum of your phosphorescent compound matches it precisely.

00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:04,750
The copper coils are of a design peculiar to your shop.

00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:08,200
The evidence is irrefutable.

00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,500
..

00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,840
And if I admit it, what then?

00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:13,759
A man must eat and there are those who pay handsomely for my skills.

00:30:13,759 --> 00:30:14,820
..

00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,780
Indeed, but in this case,

00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:20,789
your payment has placed an innocent clerk under suspicion of treachery.

00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,380
For whom do you work?

00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:24,420
That is the question.

00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:26,140
I cannot tell you.

00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,779
..

00:30:27,779 --> 00:30:29,560
Cannot or will not?

00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:34,259
Call it what you like. You do not know the men who stand behind me.

00:30:34,259 --> 00:30:37,409
To speak their names is to sign my own debt warrant.

00:30:37,409 --> 00:30:41,539
And yet, to withhold them may sign another's.

00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:43,259
Consider carefully.

00:30:43,259 --> 00:30:48,319
The telegraph codes within that case are of supreme importance to the government.

00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:51,960
Their theft could plunge this nation into disaster.

00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:59,269
Do you wish to be remembered as the man who unmade his country for the sake of a few coins?

00:30:59,269 --> 00:31:02,879
You speak as though I had choice in the matter. I was approached, compelled.

00:31:02,879 --> 00:31:08,219
Wahan, the man with the limp, you think me he, but there is another. He is my master, not I.

00:31:08,219 --> 00:31:12,900
Another limping man? Then who are you, if not the figure seen at King's Cross?

00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:18,380
I am but the artificer. A true director of this business is a foreign agent, a man they call Von Kruger.

00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:22,679
At last, a name. Von Kruger Watson.

00:31:22,679 --> 00:31:28,299
You may recall that I mentioned a German operative active in London these past months.

00:31:28,299 --> 00:31:32,019
His methods are subtle, his agents well placed.

00:31:32,019 --> 00:31:36,190
If Holt speaks truth, we have stumbled upon his scheme.

00:31:36,190 --> 00:31:39,559
But why target me? I am of little consequence at the Foreign Office.

00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,839
..

00:31:40,839 --> 00:31:46,009
Precisely, Mr. Phelps. You were chosen because you are obscure.

00:31:46,009 --> 00:31:52,049
A packet of codes disappearing from the desk of a senior official would cause an uproar.

00:31:52,049 --> 00:31:57,099
But to place them upon a minor clerk who better to serve as scapegoat?

00:31:57,099 --> 00:32:04,190
When discovery came, suspicion would fall upon you, leaving the true thief unsuspected.

00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,429
A blood most devilish, Holmes.

00:32:06,429 --> 00:32:08,039
Indeed, Watson.

00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:11,170
Halt! Your silence will not shield you.

00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:15,739
Von Kruger uses you as he uses all his instruments.

00:32:15,739 --> 00:32:20,109
Speak now, and perhaps you may escape the noose.

00:32:20,109 --> 00:32:21,529
After a long pause.

00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:23,920
Very well. He may already suspect me compromised.

00:32:23,920 --> 00:32:24,980
I will tell you what I know.

00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:28,159
Von Kruger commanded me to construct a glowing device as a signal.

00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,110
The light was to shine through Mr. Phelps's window, visible to watchers in the street.

00:32:32,110 --> 00:32:37,150
Its purpose was not only to frighten him, but to confirm to Von Kruger's associates that the codes had been delivered.

00:32:37,150 --> 00:32:41,380
A signal, just as I suspected. Go on.

00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:46,590
That is all. I was to deliver the device through an intermediary. Beyond that, I know nothing.

00:32:46,590 --> 00:32:54,039
You know more than you confess, Holt. Von Kruger is not a man to trust secrets to common workmen.

00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,799
You have been closer to him than most.

00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:57,920
Where is he now?

00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,159
..

00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:02,539
Hesitating, he has a safe house, in Limehouse, by the river.

00:33:02,539 --> 00:33:04,440
What if I tell you more? I'm a dead man.

00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,079
You are already in peril, Holt.

00:33:07,079 --> 00:33:10,259
Better to stand with us than against us.

00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,940
Holmes' words, spoken in that quiet yet commanding tone of his,

00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,130
seemed to strike Holt with irresistible force.

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,009
The man buried his face in his hands, his shoulders shaking.

00:33:21,009 --> 00:33:22,960
Holmes, the fellow is undone.

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,640
Precisely as intended, Watson

00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,740
Fear has loosened his tongue

00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,680
He will give us what we require

00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,240
And so it proved

00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:33,400
When Sobs, Hood confessed that Von Kruger

00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,360
Had arranged to leave London by packet boat

00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,720
Within three days, carrying with him the cipher codes

00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:38,740
And other intelligence

00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:41,559
Any odd other intelligence, any odd thing throws

00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:42,960
The Limehouse safe house

00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:44,600
Was his base until departure

00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:47,500
Then we must act at once

00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,140
Mr. Holmes

00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,019
If he escapes with those codes

00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:58,490
He shall not escape, Mr. Phelps. The matter is in hand, but secrecy is barramount.

00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:06,869
Scotland Yard must not be involved until we have evidence so overwhelming that Von Kruger cannot wriggle free.

00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:11,289
Lestrade is an able man, but subtlety is not his forte.

00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:14,559
Then you intend that we ourselves should confront him?

00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:20,260
We, Watson, and Mr. Holt here, who will guide us?

00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:23,210
His usefulness has not ended yet.

00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:24,900
You would march me to my doom.

00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:26,239
..

00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,659
Not so. You shall march to your redemption.

00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:33,550
Assist us, and you may yet earn clemency.

00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,340
Fuse, and I wash my hands of you.

00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,479
Holt droned, but at last nodded.

00:34:38,479 --> 00:34:42,219
The die was cast. Holmes then turned his keen gaze upon Mr. Phelps.

00:34:42,219 --> 00:34:46,539
As for you, sir, you must remain hidden.

00:34:46,539 --> 00:34:53,939
Should word reach Von Kruger that his stratagem has failed, he may seek to silence you outright.

00:34:53,939 --> 00:34:59,399
Watson and I will face the danger. Your duty is to survive it.

00:34:59,399 --> 00:35:00,439
..

00:35:00,439 --> 00:35:04,639
I can but obey, though it grieves me to be idle while you hazard your lives.

00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:14,440
Not idle, Mr. Feltz. You shall keep the suitcase under watch. Its contents are the bait, and Von Gruger may yet attempt to reclaim them.

00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:34,639
.....................

00:35:34,639 --> 00:35:37,939
At last we reached a row of warehouses by the river.

00:35:37,939 --> 00:35:40,639
Their windows dark, their walls streaked with soot.

00:35:40,639 --> 00:35:44,029
Holt led us to a narrow door, half hidden between two structures.

00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:47,529
He whispered that within lay Von Kruger's refuge.

00:35:47,529 --> 00:35:51,539
Holmes pressed his ear to the wood, then signals me to ready my revolver.

00:35:51,539 --> 00:35:53,469
He is within.

00:35:53,469 --> 00:35:57,519
I hear the creak of boards, the rustle of papers.

00:35:57,519 --> 00:35:59,449
Steady now, Watson.

00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:00,819
We go in together.

00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:06,050
The sudden thrust, Holmes pushed open the door and we burst into the dim interior.

00:36:06,050 --> 00:36:12,550
A single lamp burned upon a desk, where a tall man with an iron-gray beard sat bent over a pile of documents.

00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:16,960
He sprang up at our entry, revealing a heavy cane upon which he leaned.

00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:22,980
His limp was unmistakable. His eyes flashed with fury as he recognized Holt at our side.

00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,750
Traitor! You have led them here!

00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:28,180
Her, von Kruger, I believe.

00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:30,860
You will not leave this room with those papers.

00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,100
..

00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,410
Foolish Englishman,

00:36:33,410 --> 00:36:36,690
do you think you can bar the will of the Kaiser's service?

00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:40,540
I think I can bar the will of any man

00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,070
who sets foot in London to sow treachery.

00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,740
Watson, guard the door.

00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:49,890
The confrontation had reached its climax.

00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:52,530
Von Kruger's hand darted toward a drawer,

00:36:52,530 --> 00:36:53,620
but Holmes was quicker.

00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:58,340
In an instant, he had seized the German by the wrist and wrenched the cane from his grasp.

00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,969
Corpse scattered across the floor.

00:36:59,969 --> 00:37:03,529
Hodge cowered in the corner while I leveled my revolver at the scene.

00:37:03,529 --> 00:37:05,840
Move again, sir, and I fire.

00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,719
You have not won yet. There are others.

00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:09,859
..

00:37:09,859 --> 00:37:14,259
Perhaps. But tonight, Herr von Kruger, the game is lost.

00:37:14,259 --> 00:37:15,279
..

00:37:15,279 --> 00:37:16,599
And thus part four closed.

00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,970
With the notorious agent cornered, the stolen code scattered at his feet,

00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:22,539
and the fate of nations trembling in the balance.

00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:29,099
The scene in that dim limehouse warehouse remains etched upon my memory with peculiar vividness.

00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:32,139
The flickering lamp cast distorted shadows upon the walls,

00:37:32,139 --> 00:37:34,699
the papers of state lay strewn across the floor,

00:37:34,699 --> 00:37:38,269
and Her von Kruger stood, a snarling embodiment of defiance,

00:37:38,269 --> 00:37:41,659
restrained only by Holmes' iron grip upon his wrist.

00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,739
Holt whimpered in the corner, and I kept my revolver steady,

00:37:44,739 --> 00:37:46,820
though my hand trembled with the weight of the moment.

00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:48,860
...

00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,860
Enough theatrics, Herr von Kruger.

00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:56,869
You are caught in the act, and there will be no convenient escape through law or loophole.

00:37:56,869 --> 00:37:58,869
The stolen codes are here.

00:37:58,869 --> 00:38:02,760
Your accomplice has confessed, and your limp betrays you,

00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,220
as the figure observed at King's Cross.

00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:07,600
The web is woven tight.

00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:10,470
You think your petty deductions will save England?

00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:13,750
For every agent you catch, ten more arise.

00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:16,180
The suitcase was but one instrument among many.

00:38:16,179 --> 00:38:25,239
perhaps yet even the mightiest machine fails when a single cog is removed tonight sir you are that

00:38:25,239 --> 00:38:31,779
cog von kruger struggled fiercely but holmes's grasp was unyielding at length the man sagged

00:38:31,779 --> 00:38:39,259
his fury giving way to resignation holmes shall i summon the yard presently watson but first we

00:38:39,259 --> 00:38:45,460
must gather every scrap of evidence von kruger sit you will dictate an account of your dealings

00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:53,079
with Mr. Holt and you will sign it. You expect me to write my own condemnation? I expect you

00:38:53,079 --> 00:39:01,599
to calculate. Refuse and you face charges of espionage, forgery and theft. Comply and perhaps

00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,480
diplomacy will temper justice with mercy. With a muttered curse, the German seated himself at

00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,699
the desk. Holmes placed pen and paper before him and paper before him. Reluctantly, he began to

00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:18,569
crawl, his heavy hand moving in jagged strokes. Weighe wrote, Holmes, turn to me.

00:39:18,569 --> 00:39:24,239
Sen, note the ingenuity of the scheme. By placing the suitcase in Phelps's hands,

00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:30,799
von Kruger ensured that suspicion would fall upon an innocent. The glow was not mere theatrics.

00:39:30,799 --> 00:39:36,500
It was a signal, visible from the street, to confirm to his watchers that the bait had been

00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:41,919
accepted. And had we not intervened, Schill, Phelps would have been denounced as traitor

00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:44,340
when the codes were discovered in his possession?

00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,579
Precisely.

00:39:45,579 --> 00:39:49,269
The most effective traps are those which require no lies,

00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:50,400
only appearances.

00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,559
..

00:39:51,559 --> 00:39:53,880
Von Kruger completed his reluctant confession,

00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,760
signed it with a flourish of contempt,

00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,869
and cast the pen aside.

00:39:58,869 --> 00:40:00,350
Holmes gathered the papers,

00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,460
folded them neatly,

00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,039
and secured them within his pocket.

00:40:03,039 --> 00:40:04,240
..

00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,159
Excellent.

00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:06,690
And now, Watson,

00:40:06,690 --> 00:40:09,590
kindly escort our prisoner to the yard.

00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,840
Inspector Lestrade will be in want of a feather for his cap.

00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,929
You do not accompany us, Holmes?

00:40:15,929 --> 00:40:19,139
Sidi, no, my dear fellow.

00:40:19,139 --> 00:40:22,500
I have yet one last visit to make, too.

00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,939
Reassure our unfortunate client and to restore to the Foreign Office

00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:27,909
what is rightfully theirs.

00:40:27,909 --> 00:40:31,109
Go on, Watson. I shall rejoin you anon.

00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:34,039
And so it was that I, with holds shuffling ahead

00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:35,859
and Von Truger glowering behind,

00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:39,420
Conveyed our captives through the foggy streets to Scotland Yard

00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:42,840
Lestrade received them with astonishment not unmixed with ye

00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,019
For to net so prominent an agent was a triumph indeed

00:40:46,019 --> 00:40:48,240
By the time I returned to Baker Street

00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:50,840
Holmes had already concluded his arrangements with Feds

00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,400
The suitcase, stripped of its sinister contents

00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,300
Sat innocently upon the heart-drug

00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:58,760
No longer glowing but seeming almost embarrassed by its notoriety

00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,099
Mr. Holmes, I am in your debt beyond words

00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:05,260
My honour is preserved, my career rescued from ruin

00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,140
How may I repay you?

00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:13,289
By forgetting this affair ever occurred, Mr Phelps, silence is your safeguard.

00:41:13,289 --> 00:41:20,510
The fewer who know how close England came to betrayal, the stronger her position remains.

00:41:20,510 --> 00:41:25,480
Then I shall speak of it to no one, but permit me to grasp your hand in gratitude.

00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:26,580
..

00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:34,140
Very good. Now return to your duties with renewed vigour and let the shadow of this episode fade.

00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:38,779
With tears in his eyes, Phelps departed. Holmes sank into his armchair,

00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:42,779
steepled his fingers, and closed his eyes. I watched him for some moments before my

00:41:42,779 --> 00:41:48,779
curiosity overcame restraint. Holmes, I must beg you, explain to me fully how you unraveled this

00:41:48,779 --> 00:41:52,539
enigma, for though I followed your steps, much still eludes me.

00:41:52,539 --> 00:41:59,980
Very well, Watson. You recall the beginning, the suitcase thrust into Phelps' hands by a cabman.

00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:02,279
The first deduction was elementary.

00:42:02,279 --> 00:42:06,260
The cabman was no cabman at all, but an accomplice.

00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:12,260
His limp identified him later as von Kruger himself.

00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,409
But why risk appearing in person?

00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:17,710
Because trust is rare among conspirators.

00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,570
Von Kruger would place the evidence only with his own hand.

00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:24,449
He calculated that a humble clerk,

00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:28,579
confused by the sudden burden, would carry it home unexamined.

00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,010
And the deal?

00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:34,440
A masterpiece of intimidation

00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,900
Most men confronted with such unnatural light

00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:39,840
would fear to touch the object

00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:41,639
It kept Phelps at bay

00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:44,460
until discovery could be contrived

00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:48,259
Moreover, it served as signal to watchers outside

00:42:48,259 --> 00:42:51,639
The device was Holt's work as you saw

00:42:51,639 --> 00:42:55,119
You perceived his hand in it from the first?

00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:56,340
Indeed

00:42:56,340 --> 00:43:04,320
The phosphorescent residue upon the suitcase handle was of a compound rare outside Holt's shop.

00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:10,010
I confirmed it by spectral analysis before we confronted him.

00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:13,949
And the weight of the case led you to suspect concealed apparatus?

00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:18,950
Exactly. Documents alone could not account for such heaviness.

00:43:18,950 --> 00:43:22,620
The coil and batteries explained it perfectly.

00:43:22,619 --> 00:43:26,239
Your patience in waiting three days before opening the lock

00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:31,409
was that to test whether the door was ha-ha-ha, hmm, RM-ful, hmm.

00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:38,389
Just so. Never meddle with an unknown device until you have examined it from every angle.

00:43:38,389 --> 00:43:43,439
Too many detectives, Watson, rush to the dramatic and perish in the attempt.

00:43:43,439 --> 00:43:47,130
Science first, action after.

00:43:47,130 --> 00:43:51,719
He spoke with such calm certainty that I could not but marvel anew at his method,

00:43:51,719 --> 00:43:56,449
truly, Holmes' genius lay not merely in brilliance, but in discipline.

00:43:56,449 --> 00:44:00,839
One question remains, how did he know von Truger's refuge lay in Limehouse?

00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:21,719
.....................

00:44:21,719 --> 00:44:27,479
When Holt hesitated, I supplied the answer, and he confirmed it.

00:44:27,479 --> 00:44:29,259
And now the affair is ended?

00:44:29,259 --> 00:44:30,679
For the present.

00:44:30,679 --> 00:44:35,840
Von Kruger will be exchanged in due course, as such matters often are.

00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:42,219
Hart may find himself in prison or under protection, depending upon the mercy of the courts.

00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:49,329
Feltz resumes his quiet post, and England sleeps, unknowing of the peril it escaped.

00:44:49,329 --> 00:44:50,459
And you, Holmes?

00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:58,340
Aye, I return to my violin and perhaps to my monograph on the ashes of exotic tobaccos.

00:44:58,340 --> 00:45:06,359
Life, Watson, is a pendulum swinging between the excruciatingly dull and the supremely stimulating.

00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:09,520
This case has been of the latter sort.

00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,850
How?

00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:13,960
Then I count myself fortunate to have shared it.

00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,819
As do I, my dear Watson.

00:45:16,819 --> 00:45:22,900
Your revolver and your loyalty are as indispensable to me as any chemical reagent.

00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:28,059
He smiled faintly, and for a moment, the keen mask of the detective softened into human warmth.

00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,020
It was a fleeting glimpse, but one I treasured.

00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:33,640
Thus ended the strange adventure of the glowing suitcase,

00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:37,039
a tale of treachery and cunning, of science twisted to dark ends,

00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,179
and of one man's unfoldering genius which turned the tide.

00:45:40,179 --> 00:45:42,360
Many more cases awaited us in the years to come,

00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:45,140
but never again did I see such a curious contrivance

00:45:45,140 --> 00:45:46,720
nor such a perilous plot

00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,200
balanced upon so small and glowing an object.

00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:49,480
.
