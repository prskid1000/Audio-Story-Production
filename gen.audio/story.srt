00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
It is with a peculiar thrill that I commit to paper the strange circumstances

00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,150
surrounding what has, see,

00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,600
are made to be known in certain musical circles as the song of the vanishing piano.

00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:13,599
Few events in my long acquaintance with Mr. Sherlock Holmes

00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,310
demonstrated with such clarity his uncanny method of deduction,

00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,440
and few occasions showed more plainly how my own role as humble chronicler

00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:26,179
and fateful companion provided both contrast and completion to that singular intellect.

00:00:26,179 --> 00:00:29,719
The affair began upon one of those damp and sooty evenings in London

00:00:29,719 --> 00:00:32,879
when the fog seems to press against the windows of Baker Street

00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:35,769
like a half-conscious spirit demanding admittance.

00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,840
The gas lamps flickered in a haze

00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,700
and the sound of carriage wheels outside came muffled

00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:43,230
as if London itself were wrapped in cotton.

00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:46,079
Holmes had spent much of the day silent and restless,

00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,929
stretched upon the settee with his long fingers interlaced beneath his chin.

00:00:49,929 --> 00:00:53,219
A familiar sign that his mind was engaged upon some abstract speculation

00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,399
had been attempting to digest the medical journal.

00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,399
Though truthfully I had read the same page three times without comprehension,

00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,509
distracted by the intense stillness of my companion.

00:01:01,509 --> 00:01:06,099
My dear Holmes, you have been staring at that ceiling for the better part of the afternoon.

00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:12,039
I cannot but conclude that some case or perhaps the want of one has occupied your thoughts.

00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:18,480
Elementary Watson, I am, as you say, occupied, but by absence rather than presence.

00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,539
You will observe that the calling card tray upon our mantel is empty and misses.

00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:32,329
Hudson has twice informed us that no visitor has rung at our bell.

00:01:32,329 --> 00:01:38,099
For three days the stream of human problems has dried to a trickle.

00:01:38,099 --> 00:01:43,859
The city of London has, quite inconsiderately, ceased to be interesting.

00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:45,549
You astonish me, Holmes.

00:01:45,549 --> 00:01:50,719
Surely the metropolis of severed millions cannot fail to supply intrigue and rhyme even for a single evening.

00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,999
On the contrary, my dear fellow, it can.

00:01:54,999 --> 00:02:01,029
The criminal class is as subject to fatigue as any honest labourer.

00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:05,219
One may as well expect perpetual harvest as perpetual villainy.

00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,209
But mark me, when the pendulum ceases to swing, it but gathers force to strike again.

00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,839
I predict that before the night is out, Baker Street will not be so quiet.

00:02:15,839 --> 00:02:21,339
It was as if the great detective had summoned destiny with his words.

00:02:21,339 --> 00:02:25,139
For no sooner had he spoken than there came a sharp rap upon the door,

00:02:25,139 --> 00:02:29,009
followed by Mrs. Zondin Hudson's somewhat breathless voice.

00:02:29,009 --> 00:02:34,759
Mr. Holmes, sir, a gentleman to see you says it is most urgent.

00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:40,120
A moment later, into our sitting room stepped a tall and somewhat cadaverous man of middle years,

00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,879
dressed in a frock coat that had clearly seen better days,

00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,400
and carrying beneath his arm a folio of sheep music so swollen with loose pages

00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:50,769
that it threatened to scatter its contents upon a heart-thrug.

00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:55,149
His expression, pale and strained, betrayed an agitation not far from panic.

00:02:55,149 --> 00:02:57,780
His hair was unkempt, his boots poorly polished,

00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,920
yet his fingers were long, delicate and bore the unmistakable calluses of a musician.

00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,199
Mr. Sherlock Holmes, thank heaven I have found you.

00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:09,439
My name is Arthur Penfield, late of the Royal Academy of Music.

00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:14,560
I implore you, sir, to hear my case, but I am on the verge of ruin.

00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,519
You are most welcome, Mr. Penfield.

00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:18,839
Pray be seated.

00:03:18,839 --> 00:03:22,349
You will find the chair by the fire the most comfortable.

00:03:22,349 --> 00:03:25,519
Allow me to relieve you of your folio.

00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:32,069
Ah, I perceive it concerns a pianoforte composition, written in your own hand.

00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:35,120
You are correct, sir, though I marvel how you knew it.

00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:44,240
elementary the ink stains upon your right cuff match precisely the fresh notation on the uppermost

00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:51,259
leaf the nervous tremor in your left hand is not congenital but the result of recent over practice

00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:58,819
upon the keys and your manner of carrying the folio clutched not as an idle portfolio but as a

00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:02,899
Mother clutches a child, speaks of personal authorship.

00:04:02,899 --> 00:04:07,750
The poor man gazed at Holmes with wide eyes, as though confronted by a sorcerer.

00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:11,299
Then you will understand, sir, how desperate is my plight.

00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:18,669
I have written, nay, I had written, a composition intended for public premiere at St. James's Hall next week.

00:04:18,669 --> 00:04:21,300
It was to be my redemption, my masterwork.

00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,019
But last night, in the valley jamo where I lodged, the instrument upon which I composed,

00:04:26,019 --> 00:04:32,740
the pianoforte itself vanished utterly. Vanished, sir, as though the very air had swallowed it.

00:04:32,740 --> 00:04:37,889
Vanished? Surely you mean stolen, or removed by porters during your absence?

00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:43,539
Would that it was so simple, doctor, but I swear to you, and to Mr. Mr. Holmes,

00:04:43,539 --> 00:04:49,019
that the pianoforte disappeared whilst I sat before it. I had just completed the central

00:04:49,019 --> 00:04:55,279
motif of the second movement when, upon striking the keys, I heard no sound, nothing but silence.

00:04:55,279 --> 00:05:01,459
I looked down and the keyboard was gone. The lid, the frame, the sounding board all were gone.

00:05:01,459 --> 00:05:07,559
I sat with my hands upon empty air. Only the bench remained beneath me.

00:05:07,559 --> 00:05:14,239
Holmes, who had been listening with eyes half-closed, now leaned forward, every feature alert with interest.

00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:18,459
You say the piano vanished while you were in the act of playing it?

00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:26,409
You perceived no human agency, no movers, no trick of carpentry, no trap-door?

00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:31,679
None, sir. My lodgings are on the third floor of a boarding-house in Bloomsbury.

00:05:31,679 --> 00:05:40,309
The door was locked, the window shut, and yet the instrument, an upright pianoforte of German make, ceased to exist before my eyes.

00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:46,519
My dear Holmes, surely this is a delusion. Our visitor was overwrought, fatigued perhaps from labour at his art.

00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:50,759
I myself, in medical practice, have known patients who...

00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:54,909
Hush, Watson. Let us never mistake the improbable for the impossible.

00:05:54,909 --> 00:06:00,549
Our client's senses may have deceived him, but we must not permit our reason to do the same.

00:06:00,549 --> 00:06:01,329
Ah!

00:06:01,329 --> 00:06:06,210
Pay continue, Mr. Penfield. Did you at once search the chamber?

00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:11,740
Indeed I did, sir. I examined every corner, opened the wardrobe, even peered beneath the bed,

00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,519
as if a pianoforte might conceal itself there.

00:06:14,519 --> 00:06:17,139
Neighbours heard my outcry and came running.

00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:18,730
They too saw the room,

00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,949
bare save for the stool and the folio upon it.

00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:23,559
My landlady insists.

00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:25,139
I have gone mad.

00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:26,519
But I swear to you, mister.

00:06:26,519 --> 00:06:27,259
Mister!

00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:31,500
Holmes, the piano was there one instant and gone the next.

00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,740
And the sheet music you carry,

00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,879
this was composed upon that same vanished instrument.

00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:40,469
Yes, sir.

00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:42,959
Every note of it, without the instrument,

00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,209
I cannot refine the piece, nor can I rehearse.

00:06:46,209 --> 00:06:50,120
My reputation and my livelihood both depend upon the concert.

00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,509
Unless I recover the piano forte, or at the very least,

00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:56,909
solve the riddle of its disappearance, I am undone.

00:06:56,909 --> 00:07:01,969
Holmes rose and paced the room, his long strides carrying him from heart to window and back again.

00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:05,679
He rubbed his chin thoughtfully, then turned to me with a glint in his eye.

00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:10,029
Watson, you recall my remark, not ten minutes past,

00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,889
that Baker Street would not remain quiet tonight?

00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:15,669
The game, it seems, has begun.

00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:17,679
A vanishing piano, Watson.

00:07:17,679 --> 00:07:20,299
Have you ever heard of such a marvel?

00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,589
Never, Holmes.

00:07:21,589 --> 00:07:25,509
And I confess, I still struggle to believe it possible.

00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:31,269
That is because you rely upon probability rather than possibility.

00:07:31,269 --> 00:07:35,099
The improbable, my dear friend, happens daily.

00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,060
It is only the impossible that remains forever barred.

00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:44,649
Let us then ascertain whether Mr. Sin, whether Mr.

00:07:44,649 --> 00:07:49,500
Penfield's pianoforte is improbable or impossible.

00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,669
Mr. Penfield, you must take us to your lodgings at once.

00:07:54,669 --> 00:07:59,800
With all my heart, sir, I have prayed for nothing, so much as your assistance.

00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,649
But I warn you, the landlady is hostile.

00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:06,160
She believes me deranged and would prefer the matter hushed up.

00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:15,900
So much the better. Opposition sharpens the wits. Watson, your hat and coat. We go to Bloomsbury.

00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:36,159
...........

00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,159
Penfield clutched his photo upon his lap as though it were life itself.

00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:45,159
I, for my part, could not dispel the image of a piano vanishing before the eyes of its player.

00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:49,159
The city seemed to close in around us, whispering of secrets hidden in shadow,

00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:53,159
as we drove towards the first act of a most singular mystery.

00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:58,159
The descent into the lower rooms of Mrs. Gaskill's boarding house was accomplished

00:08:58,159 --> 00:09:02,159
with much creaking of timbers and muttered protests from the landlady,

00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:05,159
who had reappeared upon hearing our footsteps.

00:09:05,159 --> 00:09:09,329
The candlelight trembled against wallpaper, already blistered with damp,

00:09:09,329 --> 00:09:12,710
and the air drew close with the odor of boiled cabbage and cold smoke.

00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,120
Hmm, Mr. Hmm.

00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,549
Hemphine followed like a man condemned, clutching his folio tightly against his dress,

00:09:18,549 --> 00:09:21,409
while Holmes moved ahead with swift, noiseless tread,

00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:24,440
pausing at every landing to examine the walls, the banisters,

00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,149
the very nails that held the carpet runner in place.

00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:30,539
Watson, observe the spacing of these boards.

00:09:30,539 --> 00:09:34,129
They are old oak, but recently disturbed.

00:09:34,129 --> 00:09:37,730
Note the faint discolouration along the edges.

00:09:37,730 --> 00:09:42,630
Something has been lifted here and replaced within the last month.

00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,350
Yes, Holmes, I see the difference in you,

00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:48,250
though I should have walked past without remarking it.

00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,690
Precisely.

00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:53,400
The criminal counts upon the public's blindness to detail.

00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:57,130
To the trained eye, however, each grain of wood is a witness.

00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,600
Now let us inquire of Mrs. Gaskell.

00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,160
If you're meaning the floor, sir,

00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,530
it was repaired a fortnight ago.

00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,640
My second-floor lodger complained of drafts.

00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:13,600
A carpenter from Holborn came to lay new planks.

00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,960
Hey, just so.

00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:18,870
And what was the name of this carpenter?

00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:20,340
I couldn't tell you.

00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:22,540
Some tall fellow with a red beard.

00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:26,250
I paid him in coin and thought no more about it.

00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,530
A pity.

00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:31,520
Yet red beards like pianos cannot vanish without trace.

00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,600
Watson, make a note of it

00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,740
Now, let us see what lies immediately beneath Mr. Penfew's chamber

00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,500
We entered the second floor room, which was at present unoccupied

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:46,340
Its bed stripped bare, its furniture cloaked in dust sheets

00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,440
Holmes paced to the centre of the floor and tapped with his cane

00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:53,100
producing a hollow resonance unlike the solid tone one would expect

00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:55,540
He dropped to one knee, pressed his ear against the boards

00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,500
and then smiled in quiet satisfaction

00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,500
There, Watson, do you not hear it?

00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,680
A cavity beneath, large enough, I dare say, to swallow more than draughts, large enough,

00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:09,380
perhaps, for an entire piano forte.

00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,090
A hidden chamber?

00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,880
Then the piano may not have left the house at all.

00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,290
Exactly.

00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:22,440
Now, the question remains, by what mechanism was it lowered from above without Mr. Penfield

00:11:22,440 --> 00:11:24,380
perceiving the transition?

00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,020
Lowered, sir?

00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,480
You astonish me.

00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,090
Surely I would have fez the descent beneath me.

00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,780
Would you?

00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,880
..

00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,780
Consider, the player is absorbed in his art,

00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:43,710
his mind fixed upon the score, his hands occupied upon the keys.

00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:47,880
If the entire floor beneath the instrument descended slowly,

00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,320
by counterweight, perhaps, or hydraulic piston,

00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,390
you might experience only a curious vibration,

00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:58,140
such as you described, a hum beneath the floorboards.

00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,900
Oh!

00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:01,060
..

00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:02,380
Thumbs' words struck me

00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,920
with the force of revelation.

00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
The notion of an entire piano

00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,860
being swallowed by the earth seemed wild

00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,040
and yet the hollow echo of the boards

00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,200
lent it credence.

00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,920
My friend's eyes shone with excitement

00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,300
like a scientist on the brink of discovery.

00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,570
Watson, fetch that poker from the fireplace.

00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:22,450
We shall test these boards for weakness.

00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,200
I complied

00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:26,880
and together we prized up a length of flooring.

00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,980
Beneath lay darkness

00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:32,920
But as Holmes lowered the candle into the aperture, the flickering light revealed an astonishing sight.

00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:37,760
A shaft descending into the depths of the house, lined with wooden beams and fitted with ropes and pulleys.

00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:44,510
At the bottom, far below, we glimpsed the curved outline of what could only be a piano, resting silently in the gloom.

00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:47,670
Good heavens, there it is, the instrument itself.

00:12:47,670 --> 00:12:50,670
Merciful Providence, my piano.

00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:53,680
So much for vanishing into thin air.

00:12:53,680 --> 00:13:00,970
The trick, Watson, is as old as a stage, a trap door, ingeniously concealed,

00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:05,330
through which the entire pianoforte has been lowered.

00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,420
The hum.

00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,400
Penfield heard was the sound of machinery.

00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,700
The question is, why?

00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,700
..

00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,880
With Holmes's guidance, we descended to the ground floor,

00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,900
where a locked door barred our way to the cellars.

00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:29,280
Mrs. Gaskell, though reluctant, produced a key muttering of nonsense and foolishness.

00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,320
Within, we found a cavernous space, its walls lined with coal and firewood,

00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:37,430
but in the centre stood a wooden platform connected to ropes, wheels and counterweights.

00:13:37,430 --> 00:13:44,050
On that platform, like some sacrificial idol, rested the pianoforte, unscathed but eerily silent.

00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:46,060
There you have it, Watson.

00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:52,450
a perfectly contrived stage elevator concealed within a humble boarding house.

00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:58,750
Such craftsmanship bespeaks not a common carpenter, but a mechanic of considerable skill.

00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:02,800
See the polish of the wheels, the precision of the grooves.

00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,070
This is the work of a master.

00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,950
But to what end? Why lower a piano into the cellars beneath its owner's nose?

00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:14,300
That, my dear fellow, is the heart of the mystery.

00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,880
Peft is the obvious explanation

00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,920
Yet the instrument remains here untouched

00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,830
Sabotage?

00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:22,980
Perhaps

00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:25,540
Or perhaps something more elaborate

00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:28,420
Something that concerns not the piano itself

00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,300
But the music it bears

00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,340
You bewilder me, sir

00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,710
Who would wish to sabotage my work?

00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:37,420
I am no celebrity, only a struggling composer

00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:42,480
And yet, Mr. Penfield

00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:48,340
Even a struggling composer may stumble upon a melody others desire to suppress.

00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:52,740
Tell me, your composition, does it borrow from any source,

00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:56,840
any folk song, any secret theme entrusted to you?

00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,990
None, sir. The music is wholly my own, though.

00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:03,940
Hmm. Though what? Hmm.

00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:07,850
There is one peculiarity. The central motif came to me in a dream.

00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:10,139
I awoke with it ringing in my ears,

00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:13,660
as though some unseen musician had played it to me in the night.

00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:18,259
I wrote it down at once, and it has since become the very soul of my concerto.

00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:21,490
Holmes's brows knitted, and he muttered half to himself,

00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,149
A melody in a dream, a piano swallowed by machinery,

00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,210
a brass fragment that does not belong.

00:15:29,210 --> 00:15:33,279
Watson, we are upon the edge of something curious indeed.

00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,360
Mark me, this affair reaches deeper than Bloomsbury.

00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,420
I must know who built this contrivance and for whose hand.

00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,810
Then you suspect a conspiracy?

00:15:44,810 --> 00:15:51,220
I suspect only that human ingenuity rarely expends itself without motive.

00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:56,590
Somewhere in London is a man with a red beard and a talent for hidden machinery.

00:15:56,590 --> 00:16:00,080
Find him, Watson, and we find our truth.

00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:06,060
Meanwhile, Mr. Penfield, I urge you to guard your score most carefully.

00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:13,190
For if your enemies cannot steal your piano, they may attempt to steal the song itself.

00:16:13,190 --> 00:16:19,420
At that moment, a distant bell tolled the hour, its mournfully clang echoing through the cellar like a warning.

00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:22,410
Holmes extinguished the candle and straightened to his full height.

00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,370
His face was grave, yet his eyes glittered with anticipation.

00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:30,050
Come, gentlemen, we have seen enough for tonight.

00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:33,240
Tomorrow we hunt the man with the red beard.

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,880
Thus ended the first stage of our adventure.

00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:40,410
A piano found, yet the riddle deepened,

00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:43,049
a mystery solved, yet a greater enigma born.

00:16:43,049 --> 00:16:46,120
I could not then imagine how perilous our quest would become,

00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:49,100
nor how the song itself would draw us into a web of intrigue

00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,610
that reached far beyond the walls of Bloomsbury.

00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:54,419
When morning broke over Baker Street the following day,

00:16:54,419 --> 00:16:57,580
the fog had lifted, and Mazel, the air still hung heavy

00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,950
with the acrid smoke of a thousand chimneys.

00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:02,480
Holmes had risen before me, as was often his custom,

00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:06,860
and when I emerged from my room, I found him already at the table with maps, directories

00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:10,210
and his chemical apparatus scattered around him in chaotic order.

00:17:10,210 --> 00:17:12,660
He had exchanged his dressing gown for a tweed suit

00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,690
and the energy in his movements told me that his mind had raced far into the mystery during the night.

00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:21,829
Holmes, you look as though you have already solved the case before breakfast.

00:17:21,829 --> 00:17:23,930
Not solved, Watson.

00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,019
Merely sharpened the tools with which to cut.

00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:30,180
We are in pursuit of a red-bearded mechanic,

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:37,400
a craftsman of no mean ability, who installed a trap capable of lowering an entire pianoforte

00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:44,920
into the bowels of a Broomsbury boarding-house. Such a man cannot be common. London swarms with

00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:50,769
tinkers and carpenters, but few who could accomplish such engineering in secrecy.

00:17:50,769 --> 00:17:56,440
Therefore he must be known in certain circles. And how do you propose to find him?

00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,420
By the oldest method of all, my dear fellow, inquiry,

00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,799
I have already dispatched young Wiggins and his Baker Street irregulars

00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,570
to gorm the workshops of Holborn and Clerkenwell.

00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:13,350
A red-beard Watson is a beacon.

00:18:13,350 --> 00:18:16,210
With luck, by noon we shall have a name.

00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:19,100
As if on cue, there came a tapping at the door,

00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,720
and in shuffle Wiggins, the street urchin,

00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,600
whose quick eyes and nimble feet had served us in many an adventure,

00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:29,050
He removed his cap and spoke with his usual bluntness.

00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:31,010
Beg pardon, Mr. Holmes.

00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,090
We found dine.

00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:35,890
Name, oh Ezekiel Trenchard, keeps a whisk shop off Leather Lane.

00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,030
Folks call him Red Zeke on account of the whiskers.

00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:40,650
Bids are contraptions.

00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,460
Stage rigs, hidden doors, trap mechanisms for them, theaters.

00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:48,070
Got a reputation for being clever, but not over-scrupulous.

00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,610
Excellent, Wiggins.

00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:53,040
You and your lads have earned your shillings handsomely.

00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,750
Here, take this coin and keep watch upon Mr. Trenchard's premises.

00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:00,270
Report to me, any visitor of note.

00:19:00,270 --> 00:19:03,990
Listen, we go at once to Leather Lane.

00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:07,380
Soon we were rattling through the crowded streets in a cab,

00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,850
home silent and intent.

00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:11,100
I armed with my revolver by long habit,

00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,230
though half convinced it would not be needed.

00:19:13,230 --> 00:19:15,460
Leather Lane proved a narrow thoroughfare

00:19:15,460 --> 00:19:18,380
cluttered with coast among us guards and shouting hawkers.

00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:20,320
At its far end we found the place,

00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,960
a grimy workshop with windows thick with soot,

00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:27,550
and above the door, a fading sign, E. Plenchard, Engineer of Mechanisms.

00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:34,120
Observe, Watson, the iron filings upon the sill, the heavy crates by the entrance.

00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:39,050
Business here is active, though the sign suggests disuse.

00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:42,530
Consumment in plain sight, as ever.

00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,980
We entered and were met with a curious sight.

00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:48,280
The interior resembled a magician's storeroom.

00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:52,240
Wheels, pulleys, counterweights, and elaborate frames crowded every surface.

00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:58,370
At the far bench, bending over a set of blueprints, stood a broad-shouldered man with a mane of flaming beard.

00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,170
He straightened, eyes narrowing at our intrusion.

00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,890
Who are ye and what's your business in Ezekiel Trenchard's shop?

00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:11,480
Sherlock Holmes, consulting detective, and this is my colleague, Dr. Watson.

00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:19,900
We come regarding a certain Ganoforte, lowered into a cellar by means of a trap you constructed in a Bloomsbury house.

00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,170
So, the trap worked, eh?

00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:25,270
Ha! I told him it would.

00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:27,800
Smooth as silk, down she goes.

00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,360
But what business is that of yours?

00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,390
The business of justice, Mr. Trenchard.

00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:36,770
You were hired by someone to create this contrivance.

00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:38,940
I must know who.

00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:40,890
Now, why should I tell you?

00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,520
My clients pay well for silence.

00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:47,580
Because your client intends more than theatrics.

00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:54,820
and you may find yourself accessory to a crime far darker than mere carpentry.

00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,990
Consider carefully, Mr. Trenchard.

00:20:56,990 --> 00:21:01,780
The law makes no distinction between the man who builds the pistol

00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,400
and the man who pulls the trigger.

00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:11,410
The mechanic's ruddy face paled somewhat, though his eyes still glittered with defiance.

00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:16,060
I was paid in sovereigns to build a stage lift, not to ask questions.

00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:17,970
But, well, I'll tell you this much.

00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,530
The man who hired me called himself Mr. Green.

00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:24,090
Thin fellow. Foreign accent. Eyes sharp as knives.

00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:26,970
He brought sketches. Knew what he wanted.

00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:29,920
Paid half in advance, half on completion.

00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,530
That's all I know.

00:21:31,530 --> 00:21:33,840
A foreign accent, you say?

00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,550
Could you identify his nationality?

00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,110
German, maybe. Or Austrian.

00:21:39,110 --> 00:21:41,640
Something from the continent, that's sure.

00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,220
Indeed. And this Mr. Green?

00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,700
did he mention why he required the piano to vanish?

00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,500
Not in so many words.

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,310
Only said the music was dangerous,

00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:54,020
that it must be silenced before it was heard.

00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:57,040
I thought him cracked, but his money was sound.

00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,480
Dangerous music.

00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,150
Ha!

00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:01,140
Holmes exchanged a glance with me,

00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,310
his brows lifting in silent emphasis.

00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:04,860
Dangerous music!

00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,610
The phrase struck a chord of unease within me.

00:22:07,610 --> 00:22:11,440
Holmes, surely he does not mean that Mr. Penfield's composition holds some secret?

00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:23,620
It seems increasingly probable, Watson. Music may convey more than melody. Codes, signals, even mathematical formulae can be embedded within notes.

00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:27,440
Mr. Trenchard! Did Mr. Trenchard!

00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,920
Green, give any instruction beyond the trap's construction?

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:39,980
Only this, that once the piano was lowered, it must remain below until he returned with men to fetch it away.

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:43,450
I asked when that might be, but he only laughed and said,

00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:45,600
when the last note is played.

00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,730
A curious phrase indeed.

00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,140
Very well, Mr. Gaines.

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:55,060
Trenchard, you have been frank, and I shall not press you further.

00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,480
But take warning.

00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:00,840
If harm comes of this scheme, your name will not be spared.

00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,160
Good day.

00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,710
With that, Owens turned upon his heel and strode into the street,

00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:07,840
leaving the mechanic to mutter among his gears.

00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,880
I hurried after him, bewildered.

00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:15,310
Holmes, what can it mean? Dangerous musics? Surely a tune is but a tune.

00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:18,880
Do not underestimate the subtle arts, Watson.

00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,210
Consider the ancients who believed music could stir armies or calm tempests.

00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:29,830
Consider the mathematician who may encode a cipher within notes.

00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:34,760
Suppose, mister, Penfield's melody, born in a dream, he says,

00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,080
contains a secret intended never to be revealed.

00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:43,200
But revealed by whom?

00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,340
That, my dear fellow, is what we must discover.

00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:50,170
Come, we return to Bigger Street.

00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,790
There is research to be done.

00:23:52,790 --> 00:23:57,030
Back at our lodgings, Holmes immersed himself in his volumes of arcane knowledge.

00:23:57,030 --> 00:24:00,840
He rifled through treatises on cryptography, histories of secret societies,

00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,480
and even monographs upon the psychology of music.

00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:06,140
All afternoon he pored over staves and scales,

00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:10,040
humming fragments of Penfield's score that the composer had left with us.

00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:13,800
At last, as twilight fell, he sprang up with a cry of triumph.

00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:17,250
Watson, it is as I suspected.

00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:19,410
The motif concedes a code.

00:24:19,410 --> 00:24:20,280
Look here.

00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,520
Take the first note of each bar.

00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:25,760
Convert its pitch to a letter by simple substitution.

00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,510
And what do you read?

00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:32,250
I bent over the paper, and slowly the letters resolved themselves into words.

00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,740
My heart gave a leap.

00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,360
Oh, the key lies in Vienna.

00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,840
Good heavens, Holmes, it is a message.

00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,060
Precisely. And not merely a message, but a directive.

00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:48,340
Someone has planted within Penfield's dream a melody

00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:53,120
which conceals the command to seek a key in Vienna.

00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:56,030
The question is, who and why?

00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,690
At that instant, a knock rattled the door.

00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:01,210
Mrs. Hudson entered, pale and trembling.

00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,820
Mr. Holmes, there's a gentleman below asking for you.

00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:10,830
says his name is Green. Will you see him? Holmes's eyes flashed. He reached for his violin,

00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:15,500
set it upon the table as though it were a weapon and whispered to me in urgent tones.

00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:20,800
The game quickens, Watson. Mr. Green has come to us of his own accord.

00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:26,580
Ready yourself. We may at last confront the mind behind the vanishing piano.

00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:32,240
The fire burned low in our Baker Street sitting room, casting long flickering shadows against

00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:38,600
the bookshelves and the framed Persian slipper on the mantle. Mrs. Hudson had scarcely finished

00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,900
announcing the visitor when the man himself entered, and I confess my blood chilled at the

00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:48,760
sight. He was tall, gaunt, with the pallor of one who lived more in lamplight than under the sun.

00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:52,960
He was trim-close, his hair slick-bat with continental precision, but it was his eyes

00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:59,040
that arrested me, icy-gray, piercing, restless, darting from Holmes to myself and back again

00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,220
with the vigilance of a predator.

00:26:01,220 --> 00:26:04,370
Herr Holmes, said he in a voice soft yet cutting,

00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,150
and Dr. Watson, ja?

00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,930
So the hounds have scented me sooner than I expected.

00:26:09,930 --> 00:26:13,530
Mr. Green, or should I say Herr Grun,

00:26:13,530 --> 00:26:15,750
Austrian, perhaps Prussian,

00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,660
certainly of the German tongue,

00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,150
you honour us by stepping into our den voluntarily.

00:26:22,150 --> 00:26:24,430
May I offer you a chair?

00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,870
Your courtesy is wasted, sir.

00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:28,220
I came not for tea,

00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:33,160
but to reclaim what is mine, the piano, and the melody that resided in it.

00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:35,650
You have interfered sufficiently.

00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:38,450
Yours? The piano belongs to Mr. Mr.

00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:42,780
Dild, Enfield, a humble composer who never sought entanglement with espionage.

00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:45,090
Tote dows it to being biny, this.

00:26:45,090 --> 00:26:48,570
Ah, poor Penfield, a vessel only, not the source.

00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:52,950
He dreamed the melody because it was planted in him.

00:26:52,950 --> 00:26:55,100
A modic suggestion, gentlemen.

00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:59,590
We of the continent have studied such arts deeply.

00:26:59,590 --> 00:27:04,580
In a moment between waking and sleep, we gave him the theme, never knowing if it would blossom.

00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:07,870
It did, and it contained more than music.

00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:13,220
A cipher encoding the phrase, the key lies in Vienna.

00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,280
We have already deciphered it, Herr Grun.

00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:19,900
But tell me, what key and why Vienna?

00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,100
You are clever, Holmes, but not omniscient.

00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:27,560
omniscient. The melody concealed the location of a document, an agreement signed secretly between

00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:32,940
two empires that could plunge Europe into chaos if revealed. The piano was to vanish until we

00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:39,580
might transport it safely abroad. But you, you have meddled. His voice rose and for a moment

00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:44,260
the mask of control slipped, revealing the fanatic beneath. Holmes, however, remained

00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:48,500
unruffled, tapping his long fingers together as though playing an invisible clavier.

00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:51,940
Your plan was ingenious, I grant you

00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,780
To hide a cipher within a tune

00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:57,620
Entrusted to a dreamer who believed it

00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:00,220
His own composition, admirable

00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:03,120
But you erred in one respect

00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,820
And that is?

00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:08,520
In thinking that London

00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:12,120
The city with eyes and ears in every alley

00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,680
Would allow a foreign agent to burrow unseen

00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,600
Your red-bearded accomplice betrayed you by his very uniqueness

00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:25,660
and your arrogance brought you to my doorstep.

00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,960
Groom's hand twitched toward his coat pocket,

00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,880
but quicker than thought Holmes had drawn the revolver he seldom carried,

00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,770
save at direst need.

00:28:33,770 --> 00:28:36,280
How do not, Herr Groom?

00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,960
My friend Watson also carries an arm,

00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:45,040
and unlike myself he has spent service years firing it in earnest.

00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:49,830
Track and indeed sir, I said firmly, though my heart pounded.

00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,300
Smiling thinly.

00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,100
So, you have me tracked, but what will you do, Holmes?

00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,260
Turn me to Skarnanyard?

00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,390
They will not grasp the significance of what I bear.

00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,590
The melody is still in my mind.

00:29:00,590 --> 00:29:05,700
The key remains hidden in Vienna, awaiting only the one who can read the notes.

00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:11,380
Your mind perhaps, but music may be copied, analysed, destroyed.

00:29:11,380 --> 00:29:18,880
The tomb lies also with me now, and I have no intention of allowing it into careless hands.

00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:27,880
As for you, Lestrade shall know what to do with an agent of espionage who traffics in stolen secrets.

00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:35,380
At that moment, heavy boots slattered upon the stairs, and Inspector Lestrade himself burst into the room, breathless but resolute.

00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:38,380
Horns, it seemed, had sent a telegram earlier in the day.

00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:44,120
Holmes, Watson, I came as quick as I could, and this, I take it, is our quarry.

00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:52,400
Indeed, Lestrade. Herr Grün, alias Mr. Green, foreign agent, mastermind of the vanishing piano.

00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,940
Hmm, he is yours. Hmm.

00:29:55,940 --> 00:30:00,990
Bitterly, so the curtain falls. But mark me, Holmes, the play is not ended.

00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:04,440
Vienna will yet sing, and when she does, Europe shall tremble.

00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,640
With iron restraint, Lestrade's men clapped irons upon the spy and bore him,

00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,710
struggling down the stairs.

00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:15,330
The echoes of his threats lingered in the room long after his footsteps had faded.

00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:18,030
The days that followed were filled with inquiry.

00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,640
The Foreign Office, apprised of the matter, hushed the affair with typical discretion,

00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:26,970
whispering only of continental intrigues and tanking Holmes in guarded phrases.

00:30:26,970 --> 00:30:31,200
Mr. Herm, Penfield the composer, was released from suspicion,

00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,470
though he vowed never again to trust a melody that arrived unbidden in his dreams.

00:30:36,470 --> 00:30:40,110
Horns, I said one evening, as we sat once more by our fire.

00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:42,800
I cannot shake the unease that blings to this case.

00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,500
A melody planted like a parasite in the mind,

00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,120
a piano swallowed by the earth,

00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:50,410
and a spy who claims that the fate of Europe rests upon a tune.

00:30:50,410 --> 00:30:52,450
It all seems scarcely credible.

00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,910
Yet credible it is, Watson.

00:30:54,910 --> 00:30:58,290
Men will go to astounding lengths for power.

00:30:58,290 --> 00:31:01,370
Today it is ink upon a treaty.

00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:05,140
Tomorrow, it may be a code hidden in music.

00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,960
The human mind is both lock and key,

00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,700
and there will always be those who seek to master it.

00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,170
But what of the message?

00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:14,540
The key lies in Vienna.

00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,630
Have we truly forestalled danger or only delayed it?

00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,000
We have struck a blow, not finished the war.

00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,920
Another agent may pursue the secret in Vienna,

00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,320
but Herr Grün's immediate scheme is ended.

00:31:27,320 --> 00:31:31,640
Our duty lies not in reshaping empires,

00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:36,160
but in defending the innocent who stumble, like Penfield,

00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,050
into the path of darker designs.

00:31:39,050 --> 00:31:41,590
I could not argue with this philosophy,

00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,320
though it left me with a gnawing sense

00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,520
that larger forces moved beyond the grasp of any detective.

00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,090
However brilliant, Holmes leaned back,

00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:51,900
his keen profile illuminated by the lamplight,

00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,640
and drew his violin from its case.

00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:00,410
Listen, Watson, here is the theme as Penfield dreamed it.

00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:04,300
He played the haunting string, notes rising like ghosts in the air.

00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:09,660
To my ears it was both beautiful and sorrowful, a whisper from some realm beyond reason.

00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,450
Yet as Holmes played, I fancied I heard beneath the melody another voice,

00:32:13,450 --> 00:32:16,450
the echo of groom's warning that Vienna would yet sing.

00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,370
When the final note faded, Holmes lowered the bow,

00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,250
though his eyes, half-closed, betrayed a fatigue deeper than physical.

00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:35,160
it is finished watson for now remember always every tune has its last note the trick is to know when it has truly ended

00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:38,650
And so, continued the affair of the song of the vanishing piano.

00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:43,870
A case unlike any other, where espionage, music and human imagination intertwined.

00:32:43,870 --> 00:32:47,830
To this day, whenever I hear the lonely strains of a violin in the night,

00:32:47,830 --> 00:32:51,000
I recall the vision of that piano sinking into the earth.

00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:54,880
The cry of a spy undone and the figure of Sherlock Holmes declaring,

00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:58,480
with his customary calm, that for him, everything was elementary.

00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:58,680
.
