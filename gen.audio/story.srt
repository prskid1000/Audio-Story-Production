00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,439
It is an oft-forgotten truth that the most singular of my friend's adventures did not always arrive,

00:00:05,439 --> 00:00:09,059
upon his desk, by telegram, or through some noble client at the door.

00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:14,740
Frequently, they entered our lives by the oddest of chances, like trifles, dropped in the gutter,

00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:17,730
which to ordinary eyes would seem beneath consideration.

00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:23,780
It was one such trifle, in the form of a goose and an old hat, that ushered in the affair of the blue carbuncle.

00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:27,560
The morning was bitterly cold. Snow lay upon the streets of London,

00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,680
and the fog of December plunged to the lamps like a shroud,

00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:34,469
I had determined, after a quiet breakfast at my Kensington lodging,

00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:38,059
to call upon my old companion and wish him the compliments of the season.

00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:42,519
I confess, too, that I had a desire to see what strange humour possessed him,

00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:45,189
for when Sherlock Holmes passed his time in idleness,

00:00:45,189 --> 00:00:48,449
he was a sore trial to himself and to his friends.

00:00:48,449 --> 00:00:51,789
Arriving at Baker Street, I found him, as so often before,

00:00:51,789 --> 00:00:55,039
lounging in his dressing gown, armed with a pipe-curling blue smoke,

00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,460
Above his head, an eye is fixed in contemplative absorption upon some object to study.

00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:00,699
But what object?

00:01:00,699 --> 00:01:05,229
Not the lens and retort of chemistry, nor the revolver which he deemed with military precision,

00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:08,980
but a broken old hat, weather-stained and battered beyond polite use.

00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:13,069
Beside it, most curiously, lay a large Christmas goose upon a tree.

00:01:13,069 --> 00:01:18,250
My dear Holmes, said I, placing my gloves upon the mantle, what mischief is this?

00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,370
I had thought to find you deep in monograph or experiment,

00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,689
yet you sit gazing at a hat as though it were the crown of England.

00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:31,800
Not mischief, Watson, knowledge, replied he, lifting the object with a delicate forefinger.

00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,580
To your unpracticed eye it is but an old felt hat.

00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:43,310
To mine it is a record of its owner's character, habits, fortune, and misfortune.

00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:48,159
Every crease tells a story, every stain is a word upon a page.

00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,820
It is, if you like, a novel written in felt.

00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:56,790
I laughed. Come, Holmes, you cannot pretend you can deduce more than that.

00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:01,400
Some poor fellow has lost both supper and headgear upon a frosty night.

00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:07,260
On the contrary, he said, with that quiet confidence I had come to know so well.

00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:15,120
Fyhead, this hat is full of suggestion. Observe the size, Watson. Large, very large.

00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:24,310
Its owner is a man of considerable brain, and yet see the discoloured lining, the frayed edges.

00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,680
He has fallen on evil days, though once of good station.

00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,019
There is dust here, but no polish.

00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:37,219
He does not brush it as once he did, yet he tries to maintain appearances.

00:02:37,219 --> 00:02:41,340
A moral man, striving against adversity.

00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,439
Really, Holmes, this is too much.

00:02:43,439 --> 00:02:46,120
You speak as though you had lived a year with the fellow.

00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,310
It is elementary.

00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:52,579
Note again, the hat has a loop for securing a strap,

00:02:52,579 --> 00:02:55,159
but the strap is missing.

00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:56,340
Careless.

00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:00,090
Yet the brim is not torn, so he is not a man of violence.

00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:03,110
There are the faintest traces of hair oil.

00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:06,439
He has tried to dress respectably for some occasion,

00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:09,569
though not lately, for the oil is stale.

00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:12,020
His wife no longer attends to him,

00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:19,240
else she would keep him better groomed hence domestic separation from all this i pictured

00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:26,219
a once prosperous man fallen into hard times self-respecting still but slackening under

00:03:26,219 --> 00:03:32,660
misfortune homes you astound me if all this be true the man is half revealed to us already

00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,379
tin but what of the goose surely that cannot speak the goose speaks less clearly but speaks

00:03:39,379 --> 00:03:45,539
nonetheless, Holmes said, touching its breast. It was fattened in the country and sent up to

00:03:45,539 --> 00:03:51,359
town for the holiday. Our friend Peterson, the commissioner, acquired both bird and hat last

00:03:51,359 --> 00:03:57,500
night when some roughs set upon the fellow at Dotnum Court Road. The man defended himself,

00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:04,159
dropped his goose, lost his hat, and fled. Peterson, being honest, brought both here.

00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,099
Very commendable of him, yet hardly the stuff of an investigation worthy of your talents

00:04:10,099 --> 00:04:15,460
Holmes leaned back, pipe smoke wreathed about his sharp profile

00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:18,779
My dear Watson, you missed the spot

00:04:18,779 --> 00:04:24,279
Here we have a fragment of a life and from it we may reconstruct the whole

00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:30,339
Even if the case leads us no further than the kitchen, it will amuse my powers of deduction

00:04:30,339 --> 00:04:37,719
He chuckled, and I could not but join in his humour, though I felt that my friend was wasting himself upon trifles.

00:04:37,719 --> 00:04:45,549
Still, I had learnt never to doubt his instinct, for more than once had an apparently trivial circumstance unfolded into the gravest of crimes.

00:04:45,549 --> 00:04:53,069
We were yet speaking, when the door opened and Peterson himself appeared, a stout, honest fellow, his face a girl with excitement.

00:04:53,069 --> 00:04:58,359
He carried under his arm the velly goose which had lain upon the tray, but now gutted and plucked.

00:04:58,359 --> 00:05:01,869
Beg pardon, Mr. Holmes, but look here, sir.

00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:04,669
When my wife was cleaning the goose for roasting,

00:05:04,669 --> 00:05:07,149
she found this inside the crop.

00:05:07,149 --> 00:05:10,259
From his pocket, he drew a small leather case

00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,579
and from the case, a glittering stone of such deep blue

00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:17,059
that it seemed to hold the light of heaven within its facets.

00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:20,709
Even I, no expert in gems, could not mistake its worth.

00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:22,599
Holmes uttered a cry of satisfaction

00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:24,559
and held the jewel up to the window

00:05:24,559 --> 00:05:27,939
where the winter sunlight broke it into a thousand fires.

00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:33,499
By the Lord Peterson, you have stumbled upon the adventure of the season.

00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:36,729
This is the blue carbuncle itself.

00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:43,599
The blue carbuncle, I exclaimed, surely not the very gem which was stolen from the Countess of Morka's hotel suite last week.

00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:44,879
It was in every paper.

00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:45,929
King of God?

00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:47,259
The same, Watson.

00:05:47,259 --> 00:05:51,559
The most precious stone in Europe, valued at more than two thousand pounds.

00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:55,499
A gem with a history written in blood and lust.

00:05:55,499 --> 00:06:03,659
and now, mirabile dictu, it turns up inside the crop of a Christmas goose left upon my hearth.

00:06:03,659 --> 00:06:07,599
What are we to do, sir? It is no trifle to hold such a treasure.

00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:12,139
Do, my good fellow, we shall restore it to its rightful owner.

00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:17,579
But, the question, the delicious question is how it passed from a lady's jewel case

00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:19,799
into the stomach of your goose.

00:06:19,799 --> 00:06:25,289
That is the chain of reasoning which we must now unravel.

00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:30,789
Holmes, said I, at last I see the worth of your hat and goose.

00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:33,449
This promises to be a case indeed.

00:06:33,449 --> 00:06:35,509
Holmes's eyes deemed.

00:06:35,509 --> 00:06:39,639
Yes, Watson, a case worthy of our best efforts.

00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,499
The adventure of the blue carbuncle has begun.

00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:48,119
And so, from a frosty street fight, a broken hat and an oddery goose,

00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:52,399
there opened before us a tale as strange as any in the chronicles of Baker Street.

00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:56,419
The sight of that remarkable stone clittering upon Holmes' palm

00:06:56,419 --> 00:06:59,329
changed the whole complexion of the, hmm, affair.

00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:01,849
Hmm, what had seemed a trivial curiosity.

00:07:01,849 --> 00:07:05,259
The battered hat, the battered hat, the abandoned goose

00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:09,719
were suddenly revealed as the key to a crime which had shaken all of London.

00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,129
I confess my heart quickened, for though I am a man of medicine,

00:07:13,129 --> 00:07:16,459
not prone to superstition, it felt as though fate herself

00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:21,059
had placed the blue carbuncle in our very rooms, demanding explanation.

00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:25,089
Holmes rose from his chair with the air of a general setting troops upon the march.

00:07:25,089 --> 00:07:29,089
He paced before the fire, the jewels still twinkling between finger and thumb,

00:07:29,089 --> 00:07:31,329
while Peterson stood dumbfounded.

00:07:31,329 --> 00:07:35,499
Peterson, you have acted with admirable honesty.

00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:38,619
You will take this stone at once to Scotland Yard

00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:42,699
and hand it over with a statement of how it came into your possession.

00:07:42,699 --> 00:07:46,079
But stay, you shall first leave the goose.

00:07:46,079 --> 00:07:52,489
It is no longer of service to me, and your family shall enjoy it for supper.

00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:56,249
As for the hat, I shall keep it for the present.

00:07:56,249 --> 00:08:01,459
Very good, sir. But what of the man who dropped them? Ought we not to advertise?

00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:08,789
Patience, my good fellow. We shall trace the true owner soon enough. Leave that part to me.

00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:14,579
Peterson bowed and withdrew, clutching the goose, his expression, a mixture of bewilderment and pride.

00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:20,709
When the door had closed, Holmes tossed the gem lightly into the air and caught it again with the dexterity of a juggler.

00:08:20,709 --> 00:08:23,519
There lies our problem, Watson.

00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:32,429
How did the blue carbuncle find its way from the Countess of Morcar's jewel case into the throat of a Christmas goose?

00:08:32,429 --> 00:08:38,229
It was stolen, you recall, from her hotel suite at the Cosmopolitan.

00:08:38,229 --> 00:08:39,859
I heard...

00:08:39,859 --> 00:08:47,559
A plumber named John Horner was arrested on suspicion for he had been working in the room.

00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:52,779
But the case against him is weak, resting chiefly on the word of the Countess's maid.

00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,689
The gem was not found in his possession.

00:08:55,689 --> 00:09:00,189
He lies now in Gale protesting innocence.

00:09:00,189 --> 00:09:04,289
Then the matter is not so settled as the papers would have us believe?

00:09:04,289 --> 00:09:06,899
Hmm, far from it.

00:09:06,899 --> 00:09:07,339
Hmm.

00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:14,519
Horner is an ill-starred creature, with a record for petty theft, yet I cannot believe he engineered

00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,639
so daring a robbery. No, Watson, the truth is subtler. As always, we must follow the trail

00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:28,499
of the goose. For, mark you, the bird is not a common fowl, but one brought specially from a

00:09:28,499 --> 00:09:34,819
club. The Alpha Inn, to be precise. Peterson's man heard the fellow who lost it. Say so,

00:09:34,819 --> 00:09:36,349
during the scuffle.

00:09:36,349 --> 00:09:37,849
The Alpha Inn.

00:09:37,849 --> 00:09:39,519
Then by tracing the supply of geese

00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,499
to that establishment,

00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,649
we may reach the mysterious owner.

00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,109
Precisely.

00:09:44,109 --> 00:09:45,669
You see the game, Watson.

00:09:45,669 --> 00:09:48,019
From the Alpha, we trace the supplier.

00:09:48,019 --> 00:09:50,069
From the supplier, the breeder.

00:09:50,069 --> 00:09:53,219
And till at last we reach the source.

00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,389
And somewhere along that path,

00:09:55,389 --> 00:09:56,939
we shall meet the man

00:09:56,939 --> 00:09:59,099
who placed a priceless stone

00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:02,079
into the crop of a Christmas goose.

00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,219
That, my dear friend,

00:10:04,219 --> 00:10:07,199
is a man I intend to know.

00:10:07,199 --> 00:10:09,719
I could not restrain a laugh of admiration

00:10:09,719 --> 00:10:11,439
at the audacity of the plan.

00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:12,819
Holmes, with his usual energy,

00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,389
donned his coat and muffler.

00:10:14,389 --> 00:10:17,609
Holmes, surely you do not mean to set forth immediately?

00:10:17,609 --> 00:10:19,159
The streets are thick with snow

00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,319
and you have not yet breakfasted.

00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:23,729
My breakfast can wait.

00:10:23,729 --> 00:10:26,289
Adventure is the best stimulant.

00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:29,029
Come, Watson, your company is essential.

00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,599
I have always said,

00:10:30,599 --> 00:10:33,099
you are the whetstone upon which

00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:35,769
I sharpened my deductions.

00:10:35,769 --> 00:10:38,999
Flattered, I wrapped myself in my own heavy greatcoat

00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,469
and me sallied forth into the biting wind.

00:10:41,469 --> 00:10:43,529
The Alpha Inn stood in Bloomsbury,

00:10:43,529 --> 00:10:45,069
a respectable public house,

00:10:45,069 --> 00:10:46,899
frequented by tradesmen and clerks.

00:10:46,899 --> 00:10:50,019
Within it was warm with firelight and the smell of ale.

00:10:50,019 --> 00:10:51,919
Behind the bar stood a portly landlord

00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:53,759
who regarded Holmes with surprise

00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:56,459
as he strode in with his usual delectness.

00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:00,419
You supplied geese to your members at this season?

00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:01,759
That's right, sir.

00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,089
Each man may take his word for Christmas.

00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:05,459
Excellent.

00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:10,169
Could you oblige me by telling me to whom this particular goose belonged?

00:11:10,169 --> 00:11:17,209
Well, now that would be Mr. Henry Baker, tall gentleman, thin, red nose, wore a tattered hat.

00:11:17,209 --> 00:11:21,269
He took his goose, but from what I hear, lost it in a scuffle outside.

00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:22,919
A shame, too.

00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,349
Indeed?

00:11:24,349 --> 00:11:27,309
And do you have Mr. Baker's address?

00:11:27,309 --> 00:11:28,859
I'm afraid not.

00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:33,059
He's but a casual member, but he'll be back, no doubt, for his ale.

00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:34,469
What do you ask?

00:11:34,469 --> 00:11:37,139
Merely to restore his property.

00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:38,939
Thank you, my good sir.

00:11:38,939 --> 00:11:41,559
You have rendered me a service.

00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:46,039
So, back upon the snowy street, Holmes' eyes gleamed with triumph.

00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:49,629
You perceive, Watson, we now hold the thread.

00:11:49,629 --> 00:11:55,879
The hat, the goose, the landlord's description all point to one Henry Baker.

00:11:55,879 --> 00:12:00,489
We must advertise his discovery in the evening papers.

00:12:00,489 --> 00:12:05,249
Should he present himself, we shall test the truth of my deductions.

00:12:05,249 --> 00:12:09,209
But if he be innocent, Holmes, what danger to him in coming forward?

00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:10,819
None whatever.

00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:13,419
If guilty, he will never appear.

00:12:13,419 --> 00:12:15,919
That, too, will tell us much.

00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:18,559
Either way, we advance.

00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:21,559
Thus resolved, we returned to Baker Street,

00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:24,079
where Holmes composed a notice for the evening editions,

00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,749
offering that the finder of a lost goose and hat might recover them by applying to 221B.

00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,109
The day passed in anxious expectation.

00:12:32,109 --> 00:12:36,729
I confess I spent the hours in speculation, turning over Holmes' deductions in my mind.

00:12:36,729 --> 00:12:41,609
Evening fell, lamps were lit, and at last a timid ring echoed upon the stair.

00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:43,739
Holmes sprang to his feet.

00:12:43,739 --> 00:12:49,139
A fish bites, Watson. Let us see what manner of man Henry Baker may be.

00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:52,799
Inshuffled, a tall, thin fellow, his nose red from drink,

00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:54,939
his clothes threadbare yet respectable.

00:12:54,939 --> 00:12:56,679
He bowed with nervous dignity.

00:12:56,679 --> 00:12:59,079
Good evening, gentlemen.

00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:02,469
I believe you have advertised concerning a goose and a hat.

00:13:02,469 --> 00:13:04,699
I am the unfortunate owner.

00:13:04,699 --> 00:13:07,049
Pray be seated, Mr. Baker.

00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:10,809
Here is your hat, somewhat the worse for its adventures.

00:13:10,809 --> 00:13:16,719
And as for the goose, I regret to say it has already been consumed.

00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:20,439
Eaten, sir? Then what remains for me?

00:13:20,439 --> 00:13:23,249
Fear not. We are men of honour.

00:13:23,249 --> 00:13:28,409
Permit me to offer you another bird of equal weight and quality.

00:13:28,409 --> 00:13:32,569
Why, sir, you overwhelm me. I thank you most sincerely.

00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:36,869
One question only. Did you purchase the goose yourself?

00:13:36,869 --> 00:13:40,819
No, sir. It was given to the Alpha Inn.

00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:45,179
Each year, they distribute geese among members, and this was mine.

00:13:45,179 --> 00:13:47,839
Beyond that, I know nothing.

00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,879
I see. Then you are satisfied?

00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,039
Entirely. You have been most generous.

00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:56,579
With another bow, the poor fellow departed,

00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,779
bearing his replacement goose under his arm.

00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:02,029
Holmes watched him go with an expression of keen amusement.

00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:03,769
Then he is innocent?

00:14:03,769 --> 00:14:06,949
Clearly, he knew nothing of the jewel.

00:14:06,949 --> 00:14:09,049
His gratitude was genuine.

00:14:09,049 --> 00:14:12,179
The carbuncle passed through his hands by accident.

00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:12,959
Oh!

00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,179
Our task now is to trace it further back

00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,369
to the supplier of the Alpha's geese.

00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,109
Combs consulted his note,

00:14:22,109 --> 00:14:24,259
then seized hat and coat once more.

00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:27,789
Come, Watson, the chase grows hot.

00:14:27,789 --> 00:14:29,419
We must find this supplier

00:14:29,419 --> 00:14:32,299
or the blue carbuncle may vanish once more

00:14:32,299 --> 00:14:34,549
into the shadows of London.

00:14:34,549 --> 00:14:37,739
And so, into the frosty night we plunged again,

00:14:37,739 --> 00:14:39,859
little knowing that the path of the goose

00:14:39,859 --> 00:14:42,499
would lead us deeper into the dens of crime

00:14:42,499 --> 00:14:44,549
than either of us expected.

00:14:44,549 --> 00:14:48,319
If part one of this adventure was remarkable for its trifling beginnings

00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:51,009
and part two for its sudden leap into significance,

00:14:51,009 --> 00:14:54,369
then part three may be said to contain the very marrow of pursuit.

00:14:54,369 --> 00:14:56,979
For here we followed the trail of the goose step by step

00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:59,019
through the labyrinthine commerce of London

00:14:59,019 --> 00:15:01,919
until we came face to face with the heart of the riddle.

00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,539
After dismissing poor Henry Baker, Holmes wasted no time.

00:15:05,539 --> 00:15:08,579
His eyes glittered with that peculiar excitement

00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:11,679
which I had seen only when the game was afoot.

00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:17,259
He took down his notebook, scribbled the name of the Alpha Inn supplier and declared our next port of call.

00:15:17,259 --> 00:15:28,709
The Alpha Inn received their geese from one Breckenridge, a porterer in Covent Garden, a man of brusque manner, but extensive trade.

00:15:28,709 --> 00:15:33,179
If the birds did not originate with him, he can direct us further.

00:15:33,179 --> 00:15:37,049
Come, Watson, there is not an hour to be lost.

00:15:37,049 --> 00:15:39,619
Holmes, you drive us like sleuth-hounds.

00:15:39,619 --> 00:15:44,349
But do you truly expect a porterer to recall the source of a single goose amidst so many?

00:15:44,349 --> 00:15:50,109
You forget, my dear fellow, that this is not any goose but one of a particular batch,

00:15:50,109 --> 00:15:51,979
threatened for the holiday trade.

00:15:51,979 --> 00:15:57,329
In such cases, the chain of custody is short and distinct.

00:15:57,329 --> 00:16:02,959
It is a matter of following the thread backward until it reaches the spindle.

00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:08,689
We set off at once, and soon the rattle of handsome weeds carried us into the heart of Covent Garden.

00:16:08,689 --> 00:16:13,219
The market was alive with cries of traders, the smell of straw and poultry,

00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:16,849
and the chatter of buyers haggling beneath the flickering gas lamps.

00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:20,989
Amidst the din stood Breckenridge's stall, piled high with birds and game,

00:16:20,989 --> 00:16:24,859
the man himself a red-faced fellow with sleeves rolled high.

00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:30,929
Good evening, Mr. Breckenridge. I understand you supplied geese to the Alpha Inn.

00:16:30,929 --> 00:16:32,359
That's right, sir.

00:16:32,359 --> 00:16:34,099
What of it?

00:16:34,099 --> 00:16:39,069
If it's a complaint about the quality, you'll find none better in the market.

00:16:39,069 --> 00:16:41,579
No complaint, but curiosity.

00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:45,249
Could you inform me from whom you purchased those geese?

00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:48,609
Now look here, sir. That's my business.

00:16:48,609 --> 00:16:51,319
Do you take me for a gossiping old woman?

00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:54,539
I sell to whom I please, and from whom I please,

00:16:54,539 --> 00:16:57,219
and I'll not be pestered by busybodies.

00:16:57,219 --> 00:17:00,679
Come, my good man, it is of no consequence to you.

00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:03,929
My friend only wishes to trace a bird to its source.

00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:07,289
Then he may trace it elsewhere, for I'll not tell him a word.

00:17:07,289 --> 00:17:12,099
I've had enough of inquisitive fellows sniffing about my geese all day.

00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,529
First a tall chap in a flat cap, now you two.

00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:18,900
What's in those birds, eh? Gold sovereigns?

00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:24,000
Something of greater value, perhaps, said Holmes softly.

00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,879
But Breckenridge folded his arms obstinately,

00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,799
and no amount of persuasion would use in his tongue.

00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:35,960
No! Holmes regarded him with a twinkle, then suddenly proposed a wager on the weight of one of the birds.

00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,899
Poulterer, whose pride was touched, entered eagerly into the bet.

00:17:39,899 --> 00:17:42,990
Holmes lost intentionally, paying the man a sovereign.

00:17:42,990 --> 00:17:45,409
This act mollified him considerably.

00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:50,409
Now, Breckenridge, said Holmes, pocketing his empty purse,

00:17:50,409 --> 00:17:54,319
I have been fairly beaten, and I hold no grudge.

00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:58,559
But tell me, who has been asking you questions about those geese?

00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:04,490
A rough fellow, name of Ryder, works at the Hotel Cosmopolitan.

00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:08,819
He came prying about not two hours ago, wanting to know who bought a certain bird.

00:18:08,819 --> 00:18:11,750
When I would say, he grew hot under the collar.

00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,960
That's all I know, and enough too.

00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,670
Ryder, you say? Excellent!

00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:20,110
And these geese, where did you obtain them originally?

00:18:20,110 --> 00:18:24,279
From a dealer named Mrs. Oapshot, down by Brixton.

00:18:24,279 --> 00:18:28,269
She rears birds, and I take her stock every year.

00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:31,569
You have been most helpful, Mr. Breckenridge.

00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,819
I thank you for your candor.

00:18:33,819 --> 00:18:37,099
We withdrew, Holmes smiling at my bewildered expression.

00:18:37,099 --> 00:18:38,840
Holmes, who is this Ryder,

00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,969
and what interest can a hotel commissioner have in geese?

00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:45,139
My dear Watson, you forget your newspapers.

00:18:45,139 --> 00:18:48,940
Ryder is head attendant at the Cosmopolitan,

00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:53,170
the very hotel where the blue carbuncle was stolen.

00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,319
If he is sniffing after geese,

00:18:55,319 --> 00:18:57,720
I should wager a month's pension.

00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,680
He knows more of the jewel than he has yet confessed.

00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,130
Then we are closing upon our quarry.

00:19:04,130 --> 00:19:08,750
Step by step, from the Alpha to Breckenridge,

00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:12,849
from Breckenridge to Oakshot, from Oakshot to Ryder.

00:19:12,849 --> 00:19:15,430
The line tightens like a snare.

00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,670
Come, Watson, we must see this.

00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:19,730
Mrs. Oakshot at once.

00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,300
It was a long, cold drive to Brixton,

00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,539
the snow whirling about our cab like a host of phantom riders,

00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:30,619
When at last we reached the humble dwelling of Mrs. Oakshott, we found the shutters closed

00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:34,650
and no one within save a maid who informed us that her mistress was absent.

00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:38,659
Disappointed, Holmes left a note and we turned back toward Baker Street.

00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:43,909
We had scarcely arrived, however, when our landlady ushered in a man whose agitation was plain.

00:19:43,909 --> 00:19:48,279
He was tall, sharp, featured, with restless eyes and trembling hands.

00:19:48,279 --> 00:19:52,359
Holmes glanced at me and I saw the spark of recognition leap in his face.

00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:59,879
Ah, Mr. Ryder, I believe you come upon business connected with a goose?

00:19:59,879 --> 00:20:05,569
Yes, sir, yes indeed. I heard you had advertised concerning one. I wish to inquire.

00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:11,759
Compose yourself, sir. Be seated. You are head attendant at the Cosmopolitan, I think?

00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:16,659
...

00:20:16,659 --> 00:20:17,759
That's right, sir.

00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:23,079
And your interest in geese is not entirely professional?

00:20:23,079 --> 00:20:27,509
Aye, well, it was my sister who bred the birds, Mrs. Oakshott of Brixton.

00:20:27,509 --> 00:20:30,529
One of them, a fine white goose, came into your hands by chance.

00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:34,789
I would be most obliged if you could return it to me, for it was not mine to give.

00:20:34,789 --> 00:20:39,869
Alas, my dear rider, that goose has already been eaten.

00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:42,829
Eaten? Then all is lost.

00:20:42,829 --> 00:20:46,700
His cry was so full of despair that I started from my chair.

00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:51,710
forms, however, remained composed, his eyes fixed like steel upon the trembling man.

00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,259
Not all, Ryder. The stone you placed within it is safe.

00:20:56,259 --> 00:21:00,940
At these words, the man leapt from his seat, his face blanched to the colour of ashes,

00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,980
and he staggered as though struck.

00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:06,030
Stone? You know, then, you have it?

00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:09,119
Yes, the blue carbuncle is recovered.

00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:13,200
The only question is, what am I to do with you, James Ryder?

00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,369
And so the net drew tight, and the mystery of goose and jewel stood revealed in terrible clarity.

00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:24,460
The trembling figure of James Ryder stood before us, his lips quivering,

00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:29,530
his gaze darting from Holmes' calm face to mine as though searching for mercy.

00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:34,079
A secret of the blue carbuncle had been dragged from its hiding place at last,

00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:38,819
and we were now to hear the tale of villainy that had so strangely intersected with a Christmas goose.

00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:41,179
compose yourself rider

00:21:41,179 --> 00:21:43,319
Holmes said with quiet authority

00:21:43,319 --> 00:21:45,700
you are in the presence of friends

00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,079
if you choose to act wisely

00:21:48,079 --> 00:21:49,960
but conceal nothing

00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
for I know too much already

00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:55,519
you know everything sir

00:21:55,519 --> 00:21:56,179
he stammered

00:21:56,179 --> 00:21:57,399
he stammered

00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,639
enough to hang you

00:21:59,639 --> 00:22:01,759
if I chose to hand you over

00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:03,480
but it is my practice

00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,240
to hear a man's own account

00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,200
before judgment

00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,799
sit down there

00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:09,679
upon the chair by the fire,

00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,960
and tell us truly how the blue carbuncle came into your possession.

00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,889
Ryder collapsed into the chair,

00:22:16,889 --> 00:22:18,369
burying his face in his hands.

00:22:18,369 --> 00:22:20,539
His shoulders shook as if he would weep.

00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:23,429
At length he spoke, in a broken voice.

00:22:23,429 --> 00:22:26,130
It was greed, sir, nothing but greed.

00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:27,879
I'd long been tempted by the stone,

00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:29,599
hearing it was worth thousands.

00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,920
Cuffering Cusack, the maid to the countess,

00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,560
whispered to me that the jewel lay in her mistress's jewel case,

00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,490
and that the countess was careless of her keys.

00:22:36,490 --> 00:22:37,590
We found a wicked plan.

00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:39,980
I was to steal it, and together, me would profit.

00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:44,040
I swear to you, sir, I had never done a thing so bold before.

00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,160
Yet you did it, Ryder.

00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,180
Tell us how.

00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,140
..

00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,370
On the night of the robbery,

00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:54,990
one of the plumber was sent to repair the grid in the countess's room.

00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:57,890
Catherine and I contrived it so that suspicion should fall upon him.

00:22:57,890 --> 00:23:00,140
While he worked, I slipped into the chamber on some pretense,

00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,780
opened the case, and pocketed the stone.

00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,420
Then I raised a cry.

00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,390
Catherine supported me, and the poor fellow was accused.

00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:09,820
Oh, sir, I never thought it would go so far as prison for him.

00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,030
You miserable wretch, I exclaimed.

00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:16,550
The man lies now in Gaol, his character ruined all through your villainy.

00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:19,700
Peace, Watson, let him tell the whole.

00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,420
And what then, Ryder?

00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,700
I hid the stone, but I feared the police would search me.

00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,390
I knew not where to hide it.

00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,540
In my terror, I fled to my sister's house.

00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:31,260
Mrs. Oakshot in Brixton, she breeds geese for the market.

00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,000
An idea struck me mad desperate.

00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,320
it. I forced open the crop of one fine bird and thrust the stone inside. I thought to recover it

00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:43,820
later, when suspicion had abated. And thus the goose became the hiding place of a gem worth the

00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:52,160
kingdom. Ingenious, yet foolish. Continue. I marked the bird with a small tag, so I should know it

00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:56,780
again. But alas, in the confusion of sending them to Breckenridge's store, my goose was mixed with

00:23:56,780 --> 00:24:02,240
the rest. I begged him, paid him, threatened him to tell me where it went. He refused. Now you say

00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,460
it has been eaten.

00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,250
Eaten, yes,

00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:07,610
but not before its secret was discovered.

00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,980
Your clever stratagem betrayed you, rider.

00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,680
..

00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,870
At this the man broke into sobs,

00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:16,730
wringing his hands like a child.

00:24:16,730 --> 00:24:18,240
O Sardar, pity on me.

00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:20,250
If I go to prison, it will be my ruin.

00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:22,080
I shall never hold up my head again.

00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,820
My father would die of shame.

00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:25,660
Spare me this once, and I swear on my soul

00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,040
I shall never err again.

00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:30,440
I confess my own heart softened at the pitiful sight.

00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,000
At the pitiful sight!

00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,010
Here was no hardened criminal, but a weak man driven by temptation,

00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,850
now crumbling beneath its weight.

00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:40,380
Yet justice, I felt, must be served.

00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,760
Holmes, surely this man deserves the law.

00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,300
What of poor Horner, languishing in gaol?

00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:51,440
Ah, Watson, there you touch the kernel of the matter, said Holmes gravely.

00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,600
It is one thing to pity a trembling coward,

00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,980
but another to let an innocent man suffer in his place.

00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:04,740
Reader, do you realize that by your falsehood another man stands upon the brink of ruin?

00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,520
I know, sir, I know.

00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,630
I shall go to the police, confess all.

00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,880
Only do not drag me there like a thief in the night.

00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,620
Give me a chance to make it right.

00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:15,740
Would you indeed confess if I left you free?

00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:21,380
Or would you slink away and let Horner rot while you sought safety abroad?

00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:24,310
No, sir, by heaven I swear I would confess.

00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:27,060
Horns regarded him long, his face inscrutable.

00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:31,870
The only sound was the crackle of the fire and Ryder's stifled sobs.

00:25:31,870 --> 00:25:33,890
At last Holmes turned to me.

00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,760
What say you, Watson?

00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:39,340
Shall we hand him to the law or trust to his conscience?

00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:42,710
I hesitated, torn between indignation and pity.

00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,920
Holmes, he's weak rather than wicked.

00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,389
Yet if we let him go, justice is mocked.

00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:50,589
Still, I cannot bring myself to demand the gall for him.

00:25:50,589 --> 00:25:53,480
Perhaps mercy may do more than punishment in such a case.

00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:55,779
So, Holmes nodded slowly.

00:25:55,779 --> 00:26:05,039
So be it. Ryder, you are free. The stone is restored. I shall see that Horner's case is

00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:12,299
reconsidered and the truth revealed in such a manner as to exonerate him without dragging your

00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:19,559
name before the world. But mark me well. If ever you stray again, I shall not lift a finger to save

00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,579
you. Oh, sir, you are an angel. I shall mend my ways. I shall indeed. With a cry half of gratitude,

00:26:26,579 --> 00:26:32,440
half of terror, the man fled from the room, leaving us in silence. Holmes, do you think it

00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,419
wise to let him go? What if he offends again? I think not, Watson. That trembling creature

00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:45,299
is not made for a life of crime. Prison would harden him, but freedom may reform him. Besides,

00:26:45,299 --> 00:26:52,000
he smiled faintly. Christmas is a season of forgiveness. I gazed at him with admiration,

00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:56,879
as I had done so often before, for on his cold reason, Sherlock Holmes possessed a heart not

00:26:56,879 --> 00:27:01,919
untouched by human kindness. And so, while the snow still lay upon London streets, the adventure

00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,969
of the blue carbuncle drew toward its end, leaving me with thoughts upon crime, justice and mercy,

00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:12,639
which no medical textbook could ever have taught. Thus ended the most curious of cases, brought to

00:27:12,639 --> 00:27:17,489
us not by client or constable, but by the chance abandonment of a goose and a battered old hat.

00:27:17,489 --> 00:27:22,219
As Ryder's footsteps faded upon the stairs, silence fell over the sitting room of Baker Street.

00:27:22,219 --> 00:27:26,329
The fire burned low and the shadows flickered across Holmes' thoughtful face.

00:27:26,329 --> 00:27:30,440
Asshole! I sat opposite him, turning the matter over in my mind.

00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:35,839
Holmes, said I at last, you astonish me. I had thought your duty was always to the law,

00:27:35,839 --> 00:27:38,179
yet you have let a criminal slip through your fingers.

00:27:38,179 --> 00:27:43,579
Not always to the law, Watson, he replied, knocking the ash from his pipe.

00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:49,589
The law is a blunt instrument, and sometimes justice lies in a gentler hand.

00:27:49,589 --> 00:27:55,759
Ida is not a hardened villain, but a weak man who stumbled to send him to Gaul

00:27:55,759 --> 00:27:59,769
would serve neither society nor his soul.

00:27:59,769 --> 00:28:03,940
He will never forget the terror of this night.

00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:05,979
But what of John Horner, the plumber?

00:28:05,979 --> 00:28:07,769
Will he remain accused?

00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:13,619
I shall see to it that the charge collapses without rider's testimony.

00:28:13,619 --> 00:28:16,199
The case against him cannot stand.

00:28:16,199 --> 00:28:20,659
The countess will regain her stone and the innocent man will go free.

00:28:20,659 --> 00:28:22,959
..

00:28:22,959 --> 00:28:25,099
That is enough.

00:28:25,099 --> 00:28:29,839
Yet the countess herself will never know how near she came to losing her jewel forever.

00:28:29,839 --> 00:28:34,739
The great public seldom does know how close it comes to disaster, Watson.

00:28:34,739 --> 00:28:46,239
Quatson, our task is not to trumpet our victories, but to ensure that truth is served, whether in silence or acclaim.

00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:48,459
..

00:28:48,459 --> 00:28:53,239
He rose and stretched, casting aside his dressing gown for a warmer coat.

00:28:53,239 --> 00:29:02,199
Now, my dear fellow, I believe we have earned a glass of hot punch and perhaps a pipe before bed.

00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:08,419
Let us not allow the affairs of rogues to spoil the remainder of Christmas.

00:29:08,419 --> 00:29:32,199
............

00:29:32,199 --> 00:29:34,109
in the most humble of places.

00:29:34,109 --> 00:29:37,769
Holmes, perceiving my thoughts, smiled across the lamplight.

00:29:37,769 --> 00:29:42,779
You see, Watson, why I say there is no such thing as a trifle.

00:29:42,779 --> 00:29:47,709
Every incident, however small, may be the starting point of truth.

00:29:47,709 --> 00:29:51,319
The world is full of sermons and stones and stories,

00:29:51,319 --> 00:29:55,359
in hats and geese, if one only learns to read them.

00:29:55,359 --> 00:29:57,539
You are right, Holmes, I replied.

00:29:57,539 --> 00:30:01,299
Once again you have shown me how the extraordinary hides within the ordinary.

00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,899
I shall never look upon a Christmas goose in quite the same way.

00:30:04,899 --> 00:30:10,099
Not upon a blue garb, uncle, I trust, he said with a chuckle.

00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:13,169
Outside, the bells of London chimed the hour.

00:30:13,169 --> 00:30:17,549
See, beyond the frosted panes, the city lay hushed beneath its cloak of snow,

00:30:17,549 --> 00:30:21,119
carriages muffled, lamps glowing like faint stars in the fog.

00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:26,119
Within, the fire burned bright, and the strange jewel gleamed once more upon the table

00:30:26,119 --> 00:30:29,569
before being consigned to the safekeeping of Scotland Yard.

00:30:29,569 --> 00:30:32,909
Thus was concluded the adventure of the blue carbuncle.

00:30:32,909 --> 00:30:36,619
It remains in my memory not for the brilliance of Holmes' deductions,

00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,699
though they were, as ever, remarkable,

00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:44,409
nor even for the oddity of a priceless stone hidden within a Christmas goose.

00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,999
No, it endures because of the lesson my friend imparted that night,

00:30:47,999 --> 00:30:50,239
that mercy can be as just as punishment,

00:30:50,239 --> 00:30:53,709
and that even the keenest of reasoners may temper logic with compassion,

00:30:53,709 --> 00:30:54,589
and in ha!

00:30:54,589 --> 00:30:56,799
In all the years I have known Sherlock Holmes,

00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:01,619
I have seldom seen him more human than when he dismissed James Rider with nothing but a warning

00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:06,079
and though I protested, in my heart I knew he had chosen the better course.

00:31:06,079 --> 00:31:08,719
For the season was Christmas, never wasm

00:31:08,719 --> 00:31:13,809
and if ever there was a time when forgiveness should prevail over vengeance, it was then.

00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:16,509
So ends my account of the singular case,

00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:21,319
which began in laughter over a battered old hat and ended with a glittering stone,

00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:25,739
a trembling thief and the quiet triumph of mercy in the heart of Sherlock Holmes.

00:31:25,739 --> 00:32:58,680
